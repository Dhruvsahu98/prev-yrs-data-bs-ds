```python
model1 = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=2)
model2 = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

model1.fit(X_train,y_train)
model2.fit(X_train,y_train)
```

Choose the correct options:

**Options :**

6406531892480. ✔️ model1 will have smoother decision boundary compared to model model2

6406531892481. ❌ model2 will have smoother decision boundary compared to model model1

6406531892482. ❌ model1 will have same decision boundary compared as model model2

6406531892483. ❌ No comparison can be made between decision boundaries of model1 and model2

Which of the following options is true for the gamma parameter in a non-linear soft margin SVM?

**Options :**

6406531892492. ✔️ For high values of gamma, the points need to be very close to each other in order to be considered in the same class

6406531892493. ❌ For low values of gamma, the points need to be very close to each other in order to be considered in the same class

6406531892494. ❌ Gamma doesn’t affect the SVM model at all

6406531892495. ❌ None of these
