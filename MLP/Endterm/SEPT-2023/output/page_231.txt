6406532034056. ✴ Increasing the number of neurons in hidden layers will always lead to better model performance.

6406532034057. ✴ Decreasing the number of neurons in hidden layers reduces the model’s capacity to capture complex patterns.

6406532034058. ✴ The number of neurons in hidden layers does not significantly affect the model’s performance.

6406532034059. ✔ Finding the optimal number of neurons is a trial-and-error process and may require experimentation.
