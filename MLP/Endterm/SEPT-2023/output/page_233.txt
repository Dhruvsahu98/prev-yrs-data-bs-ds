For LinearRegression with equation \( Y = W_{0}X_{0} + W_{1}X_{1} + W_{2}X_{2} + \epsilon \) 
and given that \( W_{2} = \frac{5}{7} * W_{1} \) and \( \epsilon = 0 \). What will be the value of the \( W_{1} \) for the below code? (Write 3 digits after the decimal)

Where \( X_{1} \) and \( X_{2} \) are column1 and column2 respectively and \( W_{1} \) and \( W_{2} \) are weights associated to the respected columns while fitting

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
X_train = [[0,0], [2,1.43], [4,2.86], [6,4.29]]
y_train = [0,1,2,3]
reg = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=False) #intercept=0
reg.fit(X_train,y_train)
print(reg.coef_[0])
```
