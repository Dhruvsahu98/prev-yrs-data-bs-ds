```python
Consider the following Python code snippet that demonstrates the use of GaussianNB from scikit-learn:

from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1.0, 2.0],
              [2.5, 3.5],
              [3.0, 5.0]])

y = np.array([0, 1, 0])

classifier = GaussianNB()
classifier.fit(X, y)

new_data = np.array([[2.0, 3.0]])

predicted_proba = classifier.predict_proba(new_data)

In the context of the code above, what information does the array predicted_proba contain?

Options :

6406532033999. ✵ The predicted classes for the new data points.

6406532034000. ✵ The decision boundary values for the classes.

6406532034001. ✔ The posterior probabilities of the classes for the new data points.

6406532034002. ✵ The likelihood estimates for the new data points.
