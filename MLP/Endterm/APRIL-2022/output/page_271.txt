```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X,y = load_iris(as_frame = True, return_X_y = True)
X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,
    test_size = 0.2,
    random_state = 1)

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_features = 10,
    random_state = 1)

clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(clf.score(X_test, y_test))
```

Options :
A. ❇ It will output the test score correctly.
B. ❇ It will lead to an error as max_features can only be a value out of ‘auto’, ‘sqrt’, ‘log2’.
C. ✅ It will lead to an error as number of max_features is more than the number of features present in the dataset.

We are running the following code. How many times the fit() method of the estimator would have been called internally?

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
param_grid = [{'n_estimators':range(10,101,10)}]
gs = GridSearchCV(BaggingRegressor(), param_grid, cv = 10)
gs.fit(X,y)
```

Options :
