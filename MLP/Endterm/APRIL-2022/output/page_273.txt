Consider a dataset named ”dataset.csv” having shape of (10000,71) used to train the model using 
”partial_fit” method.

num = 1000
clf2 = SGDClassifier(max_iter=1000, tol=0.01)
iter = 1
for train_df in pd.read_csv("dataset.csv", chunksize=num, 
                           iterator=True):
    if iter == 1:
        xtrain_partial = train_df.iloc[:, 0:71]
        ytrain_partial = train_df.iloc[:, 71]
        clf2.partial_fit(xtrain_partial, ytrain_partial, 
                         classes=np.array([0, 1, 2]))
    else:
        xtrain_partial = train_df.iloc[:, 0:71]
        ytrain_partial = train_df.iloc[:, 71]
        clf2.partial_fit(xtrain_partial, ytrain_partial)
    iter = iter + 1
print(iter)
```
