```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X, y = load_iris(as_frame=True, return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y,
                                                    test_size=0.2, 
                                                    random_state=1)
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=5,
                             random_state=1)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(clf.score(X_test, y_test))
```

A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves:

**Options:**

A. ❌ At max min_samples_leaf training samples in any of the left and right branches.

B. ❌ At max min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches.

C. ❌ At least min_samples_leaf training samples in any of the left and right branches.

D. ✔️ At least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches.
