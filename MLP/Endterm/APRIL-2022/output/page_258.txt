We are working on an extremely large dataset. Which of the following options is more likely to reduce the difference between train and test error?

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

X, y = make_regression(n_samples = 100000, n_features=4,
                       n_informative=4, random_state=0,
                       effective_rank = 4)

model = RandomForestRegressor(min_samples_split = 3,
                              min_samples_leaf = 4,
                              max_depth = 100,
                              criterion = 'absolute_error',
                              random_state = 1,
                              verbose = True)

model.fit(X,y)
model.score(X,y)
```

Options :

A. ❌ By decreasing min_samples_split
B. ❌ By decreasing min_samples_leaf
C. ✔️ By decreasing max_depth
