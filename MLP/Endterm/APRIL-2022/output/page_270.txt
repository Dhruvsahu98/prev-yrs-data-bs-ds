We have run the following code. What do you think will be the output of the code?

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X,y = fetch_california_housing(as_frame = True, return_X_y = True)
X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y, 
                                                 test_size = 0.2, 
                                                 random_state = 1)

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state = 1)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(clf.score(X_test, y_test))
```

Options :

A. ✵ There will be no error and we will get a score as the output.

B. ✵ The code will throw an error as we have not converted the data into a pandas dataframe.

C. ✔ Since the output label in the data is continuous, there will be an error.
