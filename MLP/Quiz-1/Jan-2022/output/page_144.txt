Consider the following 6 lines of code:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
estimator = SGDRegressor(learning_rate='constant').fit(X,y)
param_grid = [{'eta0':[0.1,0.001]}]
gs = GridSearchCV(estimator,param_grid)
gs.fit(X,y)
```

Assuming that the input dataset is loaded to the variable (X,y). The shapes of X and y are (100,10) and (100,1), respectively. Does the code raise an error upon execution? If yes, which line of the code raises the error first?

Options :

A. Error in the third line of code
B. Error in the fourth line of code
C. Error in the fifth line of code
D. Error in the sixth line of code
E. It wonâ€™t raise any error
