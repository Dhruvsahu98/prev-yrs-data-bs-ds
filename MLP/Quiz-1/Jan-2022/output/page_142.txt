```python
Consider following code snippet:
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y = True)
print(X.shape)
print(y.shape)
train_X, test_X, train_y, test_y = train_test_split(X, y,
                                                    test_size=0.2,
                                                    random_state=42)
# The output of the above code is the following:
# (150, 4)
# (150, )

# What will be the output of the following code?

print(train_X.shape)
print(test_X.shape)
print(train_y.shape)
print(test_y.shape)
