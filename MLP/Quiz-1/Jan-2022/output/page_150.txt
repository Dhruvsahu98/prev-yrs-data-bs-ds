Consider the following code and select the correct options.

from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
estimator = SGDRegressor(penalty='elasticnet',
                         l1_ratio=0.2,
                         learning_rate='invscaling')
sgd = Pipeline([('feature_scaling', StandardScaler()),
                ('sgd_regressor', estimator)])

sgd.fit(X, y)
```

**Options:**

A. ✔ Regularization rate for L2 penalty will be 0.8

B. ❌ Regularization rate for L2 penalty will be 0.2

C. ✔ Learning rate decreases with every iteration

D. ❌ Learning rate increases with every iteration

Consider the following code:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
SGDRegressor = SGDRegressor(loss='squared_error',
                            early_stopping=True,
                            max_iter=500,
                            tol=1e-3,
                            validation_fraction=0.2,
                            n_iter_no_change=5)
```

When is SGDRegressor likely to stop?

**Options:**

A. ✔ validation score does not improve by at least \(10^{-3}\) for 5 consecutive epochs.

B. ❌ validation score does not improve by at least \(10^{-3}\) for the first epoch.

C. ✔ after at most 500 iterations.

D. ❌ after exactly 5 iterations.
