Consider the following block of code:

\begin{python}
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X,y = load_breast_cancer(as_frame = True, return_X_y = True)
X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 1)

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_split = 8, min_samples_leaf = 5, random_state = 5)

clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(clf.score(X_test, y_test))
\end{python}

In which of the following scenarios, the split will be done at a node N?

Options :

6406531963605. ✳ Number of samples at node N = 5. If it is split, it will result in 3 samples in the left child and 2 samples in the right child.

6406531963606. ✔ Number of samples at node N = 10. If it is split, it will result in 5 samples in the left child and 5 samples in the right child.
