In which of the following scenarios, the split will NOT be made at node N?

**Options**:
1. 6406531737170. ✴ Number of samples at node N = 10. If it is split, it will result in 4 nodes in the left child and 6 nodes in the right child.
2. 6406531737171. ✴ Number of samples at node N = 6. If it is split, it will result in 3 nodes in the left child and 3 nodes in the right child.
3. 6406531737172. ✔ Number of samples at node N = 12. If it is split, it will result in 2 nodes in the left child and 10 nodes in the right child.
4. 6406531737173. ✔ Number of samples at node N = 4. If it is split, it will result in 3 nodes in the left child and 1 node in the right child.
