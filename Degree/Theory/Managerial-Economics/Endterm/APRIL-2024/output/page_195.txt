Suppose a second firm enters the market. Let $Q_1$ be the output of the first firm and $Q_2$ be the output of the second. Market demand is now given by $Q_1 + Q_2 = 53 - P$. Assuming that this second firm has the same costs as the first and the firms are competing as per the Cournot competition, find out the equilibrium quantity for each firm, equilibrium price and profit of each firm($\pi_1, \pi_2$).
