Consider following grid world:

$\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline 1 & \\
\hline 2 & 3 \\
\hline 4 & 5 \\
\hline
\end{array}$

* All transitions cost -1 reward.
* The agent can take 4 actions i.e. {left, right, up, down}.
* An action that takes the agent outside of the grid world, leaves the state unchanged.
* All transitions are deterministic.
* Gray cell represents terminal state.
* Discounting factor $\gamma = 1$
* $\pi^*$, $v^\pi(s)$ and $q^\pi(s,a)$ represent optimal policy and corresponding state and action value functions, respectively.

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
