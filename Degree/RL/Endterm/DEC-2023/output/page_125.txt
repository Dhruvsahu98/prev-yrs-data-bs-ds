Which of the following statement(s) are correct about the TD($\lambda$) algorithm?
Options :
6406532335342.  For $\lambda = 1$, the algorithm will behave like SARSA.
6406532335343.  For $\lambda = 1$, the algorithm will behave like Q-learning.
6406532335344.  For $\lambda = 1$, the algorithm will behave like Double Q-learning.
6406532335345.  For $\lambda = 1$, the algorithm will behave like Monte Carlo and will update incrementally instead of waiting for the trajectory to end.
6406532335346.  None of these
