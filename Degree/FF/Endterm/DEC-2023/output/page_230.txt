When we do anomaly detection, a Univariate Gaussian distribution is a good choice for representing two features that are positively correlated?

**Options :**

6406532335834. ❌ True, since Univariate Gaussian distribution captures the interaction between variables well

6406532335835. ❌ False, since Univariate Gaussian distribution can only be used when the features are negatively correlated

6406532335836. ❌ True, since Univariate Gaussian distribution has a support from -Inf to +Inf

6406532335837. ✅ False, since Univariate Gaussian distribution can only be used when the features are not correlated
