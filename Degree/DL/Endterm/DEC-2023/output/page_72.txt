The diagram below shows a decision boundary of a perceptron. The weight vector $w$ is perpendicular to the decision boundary initially. The current decision boundary misclassifies some data points. After running the perceptron learning algorithm for a few iterations, the weight gets updated and the corresponding decision boundary separates all the data points correctly. Then the angle between the updated weight vector and its corresponding decision boundary
