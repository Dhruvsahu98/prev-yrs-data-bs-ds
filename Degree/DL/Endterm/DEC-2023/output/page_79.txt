Suppose we have a fully connected neural network with three hidden layers containing 10 neurons each. All the neurons in the network use the standard ReLU activation function. Suppose we use cross entropy loss with Adam optimizer with $\beta_1 = 0.9, \beta_2 = 0.99$ to update the parameters. The figure below shows the change in the value of one of the weights $w$ in the first hidden layer over the entire training duration.

```python
# This is the python code for the above paragraph.
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Define the number of neurons in each hidden layer
num_neurons = 10
# Define the number of hidden layers
num_hidden_layers = 3
# Define the activation function
activation_function = 'relu'
# Define the loss function
loss_function = 'cross entropy'
# Define the optimizer
optimizer = 'adam'
# Define the learning rate
beta1 = 0.9
beta2 = 0.99
# Define the weight
w = np.random.randn(num_neurons)
# Define the training duration
training_duration = 1000
# Define the change in the weight over the training duration
change_in_weight = np.random.randn(training_duration)
# Plot the change in the weight over the training duration
plt.plot(change_in_weight)
plt.xlabel('t')
plt.ylabel('w')
plt.show()
```
Based on the given information and from the figure, it is implied that.

**Options :**

6406532335143. ❌  definitely, the loss value at the end of the training is zero

6406532335144. ✅ The neuron in the hidden layer might be experiencing a vanishing gradient problem

6406532335145. ✅ The loss could have converged to the local minimum after a finite number of iterations

6406532335146. ✅ The loss value at the end of the training may not necessarily be zero
