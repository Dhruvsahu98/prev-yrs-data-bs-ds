Consider an intermediate feature map $H$ obtained after applying convolution operation on the input $X$ using kernel $F$.

$H = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\
3 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & -1 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
4 & 0 & 0 & 3 & -2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$

Apply the max-pooling operation with stride $s = 2$ and no padding ($p = 0$) and store the resultant output in matrix $H_m$. The prediction $\hat{y}$ is simply the sum of elements in $H_m$. Suppose $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}} = 1.5$ (that is, the gradient of loss with respect to the prediction). What is the gradient $\frac{\partial L}{\partial H_{10}}$ where $H_{10}$ is the element at the 1-st row and 0-th column? If you think the given info is insufficient, enter -1 as the answer.
