Select all correct statements about the bias and variance of deep learning models.

Options :
640653235134. ✅ A model with high bias produces high training error and high validation error
640653235135. ❌ A model with high variance produces high training error and low validation error
640653235136. ✅ A model with high variance produces low training error and high validation error
640653235137. ✅ Bias and variance can be both made zero if the underlying distribution of the samples are known and also the samples are not corrupted by noise
