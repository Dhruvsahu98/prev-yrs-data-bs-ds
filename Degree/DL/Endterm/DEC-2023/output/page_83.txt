Suppose that we need to develop an RNN model for sentiment classification tasks. The input to the model is a sentence composed of 10 words and the output is the sentiment (positive or negative). Assume that each word is represented as a vector of length 100 x 1 and the output labels are one-hot encoded. Further, the state vector $s_t$ and the prediction $\hat{y}_t$ are computed as follows

$s_t = \sigma(Ux_t + Ws_{t-1} + b)$

$\hat{y}_t = \sigma(Vs_t + c)$

The state vector $s_t$ is initialized with all zeros of size 50 x 1.

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
