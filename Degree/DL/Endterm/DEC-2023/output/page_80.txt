Consider a fully connected feed forward neural network with 3 hidden layers. The weight matrix $W_1$ connecting the input layer to the first hidden layer is of shape $20 \times 150$, similarly, the shape of other weight matrices are as follows $W_2: 150 \times 100$, $W_3: 100 \times 10$, and the weight $W_4$ connecting the final hidden layer and the output layer is of shape $10 \times 3$. The network solves the multi-class classification problem by using the cross-entropy loss function. Moreover, the labels are one hot encoded. 

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
