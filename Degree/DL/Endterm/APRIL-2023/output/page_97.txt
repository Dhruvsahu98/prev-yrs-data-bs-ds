$y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

$s_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$

$x_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$

$x_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

Suppose the weight matrices $U$, $V$, $W$ are initialized as follows

$W = U = V = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

The state vector $s_t$ is computed as follows

$s_t = tanh(Ux_t + Ws_{t-1})$

Note: In all your calculations, consider only the first two decimal places of any number (input, intermediate results..). That is, if the number is -1.0234, take it as -1.02.
