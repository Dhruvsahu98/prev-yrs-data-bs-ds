Given the true outputs for a dataset, $y = [1, 2, 3, 4]$, and the predictions from three different models (A, B, and C) trained on different subsets of the training data, as follows:

Model A predictions: $A = [1, 1, 1, 9, 3, 1, 3, 9]$
Model B predictions: $B = [0, 9, 2, 1, 2, 9, 4, 1]$
Model C predictions: $C = [2, 2, 3, 4]$
