Which statements about LSTM and GRU units in handling the problem of exploding/vanishing gradients are correct?
**Options :**
6406532755014. ❌ LSTM units are more susceptible to exploding gradients compared to GRU units due to their complex gating mechanisms.
6406532755015. ❌ The gating mechanisms in LSTM and GRU units implicitly handle exploding gradients without the need for additional techniques.
6406532755016. ❌ GRU units mitigate both vanishing and exploding gradient problems more effectively than LSTM units due to their simplified architecture.
6406532755017. ✅ Both LSTM and GRU units utilize gating mechanisms to address vanishing gradient problems, but GRU units typically converge faster due to their simpler design.
