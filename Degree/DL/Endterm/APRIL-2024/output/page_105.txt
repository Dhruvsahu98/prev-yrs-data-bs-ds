Given a scenario where there are 5 possible letters represented as one-hot encoded vectors of length 5, the RNN employs the following formulas for the state vector and output at time step $t$:
 $$s_t = \sigma(Ux_i + Ws_{t-1} + b)$$
 $$\hat{y}_t = O(Vs_t + c)$$
 Here, $\sigma$ and $O$ denote the sigmoid and softmax functions, respectively.
 Assume that $s_t \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $y_t \in \mathbb{R}^5$

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
