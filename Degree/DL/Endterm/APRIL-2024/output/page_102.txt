Consider a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification with the following layers:
1. Convolutional layer with 32 filters of size $3 \times 3$, with a stride of 1 and no padding.
2. Max pooling layer with a pool size of $2 \times 2$ and a stride of 2.
3. Convolutional layer with 64 filters of size $4 \times 4$, with a stride of 1 and no padding.
4. Max pooling layer with a pool size of $2 \times 2$ and a stride of 2.
5. Fully connected layer with 128 neurons.
6. Output layer with 10 neurons (for 10 classes) using softmax activation.

If the input image size is $64 \times 64 \times 3$, and the network has no bias term, how many parameters are there in the CNN?
