Question Label : Multiple Choice Question
Consider a scenario where you have a dataset with overlapping classes (that is instances from different classes share similar or identical feature values), and you decide to train a perceptron model for classification.

**Assertion (A):** The perceptron model may struggle to classify instances accurately when classes overlap in the feature space.

**Reason (R):** The perceptron learning algorithm aims to find a linear decision boundary that separates the classes, and in the presence of overlapping classes, it may not be able to capture the underlying patterns effectively.
