Select all correct statements about the bias and variance of deep learning models.
Options :
6406531501042. ✅ A model with high bias produce high training error and high validation error
6406531501043. ❌ A model with high variance produce high training error and low validation error
6406531501044. ✅ A model with high variance produce low training error and high validation error
6406531501045. ✅ Bias and variance can be both made zero if the underlying distribution of the samples are known and also the samples are not corrupted by noise

Suppose that we use Dropout scheme to regularize the deep learning model. Assume that the dropout probability $p = 0.75$ for all the layers in the model and the model is trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer. Choose the correct statements about Dropout regularization.
Options :
6406531501046. ❌ Dropout reduces (removes) 25 percent of weights from the model during training and inference
6406531501047. ❌ For each iteration, 75% of neurons are dropped randomly from the model 
6406531501048. ✅ For each iteration, 25% of neurons are dropped randomly from the model
6406531501049. ✅ Each weight gets multiplied by a factor $p$ during inference.
6406531501050. ❌ Each weight gets multiplied by a factor $1 - p$ during inference.
