Which of the following threshold $\theta$ values of MP neuron implements AND Boolean function denoted by $f(x)$? Assume that the number of inputs $x_i$ to the neuron is four and the neuron does not have any inhibitory inputs. 
$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } \sum_{i=0}^3 x_i > \theta \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Consider a sigmoid function
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(wx + b)}}$$
Suppose that $w$ is restricted to take only negative values ($w < 0$). Suppose further that we define the steepness of the curve as absolute value of the slope. Select all the correct statements about the function 
Options :
6406531501021. ❌ Increasing the value of $b$ shifts the sigmoid function to the left (i.e., towards negative infinity)
