Suppose that a softmax function is used in the output layer to compute the probability for each class.
$\hat{y} = softmax(a_4)$
Assume that $a_4 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$. What is the value of third element in $\hat{y}$ (if your intermediate result is 1.2345, then take it as 1.23 to the next step)
