Suppose that all the elements in the input are one (that is, $x_0 = x_1 = ... = x_n = 1$) and all the weight values are 0.1 (that is, $b = w_1 = w_2 = ... = w_n = 0.01$). Assume the activation function is logistic, $\Phi(z) = \frac{1}{1+exp(-z)}$ and $n = 10$. Use the Mean square error loss, 
$L = 0.5(\hat{y} - y)^2$ 
enter the number of weights that will get modified from their current values during the next iteration.

In the previous question, if we change all the weight values to 10, that is, $b = w_1 = w_2 = ... = w_n = 10$, then enter the number of weights that will get updated during the next iteration.
