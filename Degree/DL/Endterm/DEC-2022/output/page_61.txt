Consider a Recurrent Neural network shown below

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
\draw[thick,->] (-2,0) -- (0,0);
\draw[thick,->] (0,0) -- (2,0);
\draw[thick,->] (2,0) -- (4,0);
\draw[thick,->] (4,0) -- (6,0);
\draw[thick,->] (6,0) -- (7,1);
\draw[thick,->] (7,1) -- (7,3);
\draw[thick,->] (7,3) -- (7,0);
\draw[thick] (-0.5,-1) -- (-0.5,1);
\draw[thick] (1.5,-1) -- (1.5,1);
\draw[thick] (3.5,-1) -- (3.5,1);
\draw[thick] (5.5,-1) -- (5.5,1);
\draw[thick] (6.5,2) -- (6.5,3);
\node at (-2,0) {$s_0$};
\node at (0,0) {$\Phi(\cdot)$};
\node at (2,0) {$\Phi(\cdot)$};
\node at (4,0) {$\Phi(\cdot)$};
\node at (6,0) {$\Phi(\cdot)$};
\node at (7,3) {$\Phi_1(\cdot)$};
\node at (0,-1.5) {$x_0 = 0.1$};
\node at (2,-1.5) {$x_1 = 0.2$};
\node at (4,-1.5) {$x_2 = 0.3$};
\node at (1,0) {$u$};
\node at (3,0) {$u$};
\node at (5,0) {$u$};
\node at (7,0) {$v$};
\node at (7,4) {$\hat{y}$};
\node at (1,-1) {$s_1$};
\node at (3,-1) {$s_2$};
\node at (5,-1) {$s_3$};
\end{tikzpicture}

where $\Phi(\cdot) = tanh(\cdot)$ and $\Phi_1(\cdot) = \sigma(\cdot)$(logistic function). The state vector is computed as follows,
$$s_t = tanh(ws_{t-1} + ux_t)$$
the initial weight values are as follows
$$u = 4, w = -2, v = 1, s = 0$$
and the true label $y = 1$.

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
