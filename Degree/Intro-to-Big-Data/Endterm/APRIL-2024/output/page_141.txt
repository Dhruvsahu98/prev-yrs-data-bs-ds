Consider a Structured Streaming application running on Google Dataproc firing up every 10 seconds, consuming any number of records from Kafka available since last read, and emitting some computed answers to another Kafka topic. Consider also that apart from the functional logic, the same application is also emitting into a file the start time and end time of every batch invocation for audit purposes. 

Assume there is a failure in one of the Dataproc machines that results in a failure of a specific run. For the external world (i.e. anybody consuming the outputs of this application), will they see any change in output as a result of the failure at all, or will the only visible impact of failure be of slower performance for the failed-and-retried run?

Options:
6406532755176. ❌ No, the failure is not visible. The only visible effect for the external world would be in the form of a slowdown in runtime for completion of that mini-batch as Structured Streaming retries the mini-batch that failed thus taking twice as much time as normal.
6406532755177. ❌ No, the failure is not visible since Structured Streaming uses transactions and idempotence to achieve exactly-once processing.
6406532755178. ❌ No, the failure is not visible since Structured Streaming can process the same data in a retry resulting in the same outputs again.
6406532755179. ✅ Yes, the failure is visible because the side effect of emitting timestamps in a batch will be visible as 2 consecutive Start timestamps without any end timestamp as Structured Streaming retries the failed batch.
6406532755180. ❌ Yes, the failure is visible since the logs in the backend of Spark Structured Streaming are also logging the state of the machine.
