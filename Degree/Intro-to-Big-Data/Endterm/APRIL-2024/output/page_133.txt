Consider the program outline as below running on a Spark cluster of 1 driver and 4 worker nodes with 2 executors per worker node:

```python
sc = pyspark.SparkContext()
train_master = ... #python dictionary of trains in India (about 11 trains in total)
bookings_rdd = ... #Spark RDD that is having all ticket bookings of format (train_no, date, seats, ticket_price)
bookings_rdd.map(train_no => train_master.has_key(train_no)).count()
```

Consider the below mutually-exclusive characterisations about the program:

i. Program will not run since RDD transformation operation map() runs on Executors that is referencing a variable train\_master which is declared in the Spark driver

ii. Program will run successfully and produce the count of bookings that match for trains present in the train\_master

For either of the 2 characterizations, consider the following (one or more) actions you could carry out in order to improve on the characterizations:

1. Program will need to be changed to bring the train\_master into the Closure for executors to pick it up

2. Program will perform more poorly as the number of executors per worker node increases. Broadcast of train\_master will need to be used to make it perform better.

3. Program will perform more poorly as the number of worker nodes increases (keeping number of executors per worker node constant). Broadcast of train\_master will need to be used to make it perform better.

Which of the following combinations of statements are correct?
