A company with headquarters (HQ) in the Middle East operates on a Sunday-Thursday weekday schedule with Friday & Saturday as weekend days. It computes end of week revenue numbers by first computing sales for each day at 1AM local time of the next day, and then summing up the weekly sales every Sunday morning 9AM local time. As a result of management change, it has leadership every Sunday early morning at 3AM local time. This number gets reported to pipeline?
decided to relocate its HQ to India. Which of the following changes will need to be done to its ETL 

Options :
6406531888244. ✅ No change to business time since that remains constant at 1AM local time, only the schedule for the final weekly sum operation needs to be changed to the operational time of Monday 3AM India time instead of Sunday 3AM Middle East time.
6406531888245. ❌ Since time zone has changed as well as week definition too, the definition of business time has changed. So, the ETL has to be rewritten entirely.
6406531888246. ❌ Nothing needs to change since daily sales is available at 1AM Middle East time which is anyway behind India time and so the numbers will be available before leadership comes in at 9AM.
6406531888247. ❌ Event time has changed since the event of week ending has changed in definition, and so the ETL needs to be changed to consider the new event in the data.
6406531888248. ❌ No change required.
