What differentiates "streaming processing" from "batch processing" in the context of big data?

Options :
6406531888219. ❌ Batch operates on a set of data elements taken together while streaming operates on data individually as it streams in
6406531888220. ✅ Batch operates on data that is static while streaming operates on data that is dynamically changing
6406531888221. ✅ Batch processing can assume data as fully specified and complete while streaming cannot make that assumption
6406531888222. ✅ Batch processing is typically high latency while streaming processing is necessary for real-time latencies
6406531888223. ❌ Batch processing can operate on massively larger data sets than streaming can
