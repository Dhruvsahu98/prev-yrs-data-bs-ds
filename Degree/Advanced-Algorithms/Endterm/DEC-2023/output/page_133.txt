What is the answer if $R = C = N$ and all the squares along a diagonal are cut out? In particular, assume the square at the intersection of the $i$-th row (from the top) and the $i$-th column (from the left) is a cut out square, for all $1 \le i \le N$. For this question, assume that $N = 2K$, i.e, that $N$ is even.
