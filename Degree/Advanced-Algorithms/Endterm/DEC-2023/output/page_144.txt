Recall that the size of an optimal vertex cover is at most twice the size of a maximum matching of a graph G. Are there examples of graphs where the size of the optimal vertex cover is **exactly** equal to twice the size of its maximum matching? For example, this is not true for a path on three vertices: the size of both the maximum matching and minimum vertex cover is 1.
