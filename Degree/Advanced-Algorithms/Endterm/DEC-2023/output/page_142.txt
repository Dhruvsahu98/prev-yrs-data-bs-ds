An adversary can provide randomized quicksort with an input array of length $n$ that forces the algorithm to run in $\omega(n \log n)$ time on that input (If you are not familiar with the $\omega$ asymptotic notation, it roughly translates as "at least". For example, we can say that it is possible to come up with an input that forces insertion sort to run for $\omega(n^2)$ steps.)
