The three-bonaci numbers are defined as follows (please read the definition carefully, as it may not be the generalization of the popular Fibonacci numbers that you might expect):

$$T_i = \begin{cases}
A_0 & \text{if } i = 0\\
A_1 & \text{if } i = 1\\
A_2 & \text{if } i = 2;\\
T_{i-1}+T_{i-2}-T_{i-3} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

We give you $A_0$, $A_1$, $A_2$, and $n$. Your task is to calculate $T_n$. What are the values of $T_n$ for the given inputs?

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
