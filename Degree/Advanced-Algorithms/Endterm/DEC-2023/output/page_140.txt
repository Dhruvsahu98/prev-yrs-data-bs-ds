In the MIN-2-SAT problem, we are given a 2-CNF formula $\phi$ and an integer $k$, and the objective is to decide whether there exists an assignment for $\phi$ that satisfies at most $k$ clauses. Consider the following branching algorithm for the problem. 

If there is a variable $x$ that occurs only positively in $\phi$, observe that there exists an optimal assignment that sets it to 0. Similarly, if there is a variable $x$ that occurs only positively in $\phi$, there exists an optimal assignment that sets it to 1. Once we perform this preprocessing, assuming that have clauses remaining, we have the following guarantee:

Every variable has at least one positive and one negated occurrence.

Now we can branch exhaustively on the settings of variables. The overall algorithm is summarized in the following pseudocode:

```python
MINSAT(phi, k):
  if there is a variable x that occurs only as a positive literal:
    set x to 0
  if there is a variable x that occurs only as a negated literal:
    set x to 1
  if phi is empty:
    return YES
  if phi is not empty and k <= 0:
    return NO
  Let x be any variable that occurs in phi.
  return MINSAT(phi[x = TRUE], k-1) OR MINSAT(phi[x = FALSE], k-1)
```

What is the running time of this algorithm? Select the tightest bound that is correct according to you.
