A part of the Rete Net that classifies mushrooms (as edible or poisonous) is shown in the figure. The labels A1, A2, ..., A10, A16, ..., B1, B2, B3, R1, ..., R4 uniquely identify the nodes in the network. When required, use the above label ordering to break ties and to enter short answers.

\caption{Rete Net for Mushroom Classification}
\end{figure}

Run the Rete algorithm for the Working Memory shown below, the WMEs are in timestamp order. Assume that WMEs reside at appropriate Alpha nodes, and the Beta nodes point to WMEs residing in Alpha nodes.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
WME & Timestamp \\ \hline
specimen(n1, colour(RED), surface(SMOOTH), root(BULBOUS)) & 1 \\ \hline
specimen(n2, colour(BROWN), br-surface(SCALY), habitat(LEAVES)) & 2 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

1. WME 1: `specimen(n1, colour(RED), surface(SMOOTH), root(BULBOUS))` is added to the network.  It matches A4 (specimen), A7 (surface), A8 (colour), A9 (root). 
2. The WME propagates through A4 to A7, A8, A9 and is stored in B1.
3. WME 2: `specimen(n2, colour(BROWN), br-surface(SCALY), habitat(LEAVES))` is added to the network. It matches A4 (specimen), A10 (br-surface), A11 (habitat), A15 (ar-colour).
4. The WME propagates through A4 to A10, A11, A15 and is stored in B2.
5. Since both WME1 and WME2 are in B1, they match and the WME (n1, RED, SMOOTH, BULBOUS, BROWN, SCALY, LEAVES) is added to R1.
