**CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION**

The set of junctions (L, W, Y and T type junctions) that occur in a 2D line drawing of trihedral objects is provided below. The in-plane clockwise/counterclockwise rotations of these junctions are valid as well. These junctions provide constraints on the possible edge assignments (convex, concave, arrow) for the edges/lines in 2D line drawings of trihedral objects.

The junctions carry unique labels: L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, T1, T2, T3, T4, W1, W2, W3, Y1, Y2, Y3. When required, use the labels in short answers.
