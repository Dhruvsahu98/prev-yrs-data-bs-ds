GAMES

The figure shows a 4-ply game tree with evaluation function values at the horizon. The nodes in the horizon are assigned labels A,B,C,...P. Use these labels when asked to enter a horizon node or a list of horizon nodes. 

**Tie-breaker:** when several nodes qualify then select the left most node, if tie persists then select the deepest node among the left most nodes.
