Question Label : Comprehension

# PROBLEM DECOMPOSITION

The figure shows an AND-OR graph that depicts how a problem S can be decomposed into one or more smaller problems. Nodes are uniquely identified by labels (S, A, B, ...). The number in each node is the heuristic estimate of the cost of solving that node.

Nodes shown in double lines are primitive nodes and their values are actual costs. Observe that a primitive node is added to the graph by its parent when the parent is expanded, and the primitive node is labeled as SOLVED and it will not be expanded subsequently.

The cost of each edge is 2 units.

Tie-breaker 1: If several nodes have the same cost then break the tie using node labels.
Tie-breaker 2: For AND nodes, select the unsolved branch with the highest cost.

Edge Cost: 2

```python
# AND-OR graph
graph = {
    'S': {'A': 2, 'B': 2},
    'A': {'C': 2, 'D': 2, 'E': 2},
    'B': {'E': 2, 'F': 2},
    'C': {'SOLVED': 0},
    'D': {'SOLVED': 0},
    'E': {'G': 2, 'H': 2},
    'F': {'H': 2, 'I': 2},
    'G': {'SOLVED': 0},
    'H': {'SOLVED': 0},
    'I': {'SOLVED': 0}
}

# Heuristic estimates
heuristic_estimates = {
    'S': 10,
    'A': 20,
    'B': 30,
    'C': 20,
    'D': 30,
    'E': 20,
    'F': 40,
    'G': 10,
    'H': 20,
    'I': 30
}
```

Use AO* algorithm to solve S, then answer the sub-questions.
