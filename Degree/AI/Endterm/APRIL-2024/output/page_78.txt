GAMES
The figure shows a game tree with evaluation function values at the leaf nodes.
The leaf nodes are labeled from A to J.
Use these labels to enter a leaf node or a list of leaf nodes in short answers (textbox).
**Tie-breaker:** when several nodes carry the same best cost then select the deepest node, if tie persists then select the leftmost of the deepest nodes.
