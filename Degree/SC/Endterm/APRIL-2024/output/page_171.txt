1. Let a random variable $X$ have the following cumulative distribution function:
$$F(x) = 1 - (1-x^a)^b, \qquad x \in \mathbb{R},$$
and $a, b > 0$. Write down the steps of the inverse transform algorithm to sample from this distribution.

2. Let $X \sim Normal(0, 1)$. Suppose we want to estimate $\theta = E[e^{-X^4}]$ using the simple importance sampling method.

(b) For the above obtained $g^*$, find the simple importance sampling estimator $\hat{\theta}_g$.

3. Suppose we want to generate random samples from a truncated Gamma(2, 1) defined on $(5, \infty)$ using the accept-reject algorithm with truncated exponential($\lambda$) defined on $(5, \infty)$ as a proposal distribution. Truncated Gamma(2, 1) is given by
$$f(x) = \frac{xe^{-x}}{6e^{-5}}, \qquad \text{where } x \in (5, \infty)$$
and truncated exponential($\lambda$) is given by
$$g(x) = \frac{\lambda e^{-\lambda x}}{e^{-5 \lambda}}, \qquad \text{where } x \in (5, \infty)$$
What is the optimal value of $\lambda$?

5. Let $(X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), \dots, (X_n, Y_n)$ iid $\sim F$, where $F$ is some unknown bivariate distribution with mean vector $(\theta, \theta)^T$ and finite marginal variances. In order to estimate $\theta$, we choose the estimator:
$$\hat{\theta} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{X_i + Y_i}{2}$$
Write down the steps of bootstrapping to obtain a 100(1 - $\alpha$)% confidence interval around $\hat{\theta}$. Write all the steps clearly.
