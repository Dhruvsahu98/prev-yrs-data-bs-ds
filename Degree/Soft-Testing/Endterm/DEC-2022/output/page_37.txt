Consider the code segment of a Java servlet below. The atomic sections are marked as $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$, ... 

```python
/*
student_list, which is a collection of Student objects stores information of all the students applied for a course, student_roll and student_name store the roll number and name of students, and approval_status is true if the student is allowed for the course; otherwise, it is false that indicates the student is disallowed for the course
*/
ArrayList<Student> student_list = null;
response.setContentType("text/html");
PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
out.print("<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>");
out.print("Eligible students");
out.println("</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>");
String cid = request.getParameter("CID");
P_1 /*
getStudents() considers the course ID (cid) of a course, runs a query in the database, and returns an ArrayList object containing the information for the students applied for the course
*/
student_list = getStudents(cid);
P_2 if (student_list == null) {
out.println("Invalid course ID/<BR>");
} else {
for (Student s : student_list) {
if (approval_status == true) {
/* print the student's roll number and name if the student is allowed for given course */
out.println(student_roll + " : " + student_name + "<BR>");
P_3 } else {

}
P_5 }
out.println("</BODY></HTML>");
