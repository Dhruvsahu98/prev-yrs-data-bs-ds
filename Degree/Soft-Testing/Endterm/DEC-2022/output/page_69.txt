Consider the following Java method max().

```python
int max(int a, int b, int c) {
  if(a >= b && a >= c) {
    return a;
  } else if(b >= a && b >= c) {
    return b;
  } else {
    return c;
  }
}
```

Identify the type of mutant generated by replacing Line 4 with Line 4a which is given below.
1. 4a. `else if(b >= a && b > c) {`

A company announces a special incentive for some of its employees with designations as junior officers (designation = 'JO') and senior officers (designation = 'SO') who fulfil the following conditions:

1. For junior officers, the incentive is given if the rating is above or equal to 7 (the lowest and highest ratings are 1 and 10, respectively).
2. For senior officers, the incentive is given if the rating is above or equal to 8 (the lowest and highest ratings are 1 and 10, respectively).

A small program is written to find out the eligible candidates for the incentive.

Which of the following is a valid test case input based on equivalence class partition considering the program?
