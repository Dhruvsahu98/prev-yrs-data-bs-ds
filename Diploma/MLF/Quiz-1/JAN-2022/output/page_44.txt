The coach of Indian cricket team hired a ML team to predict whether Kohli will be successful or not in hitting a century in 2022 by using some classification models. Therefore the team collected presence/absence of various factors $x = [x_1, x_2, x_3]$ from both successful and unsuccessful innings by Kohli in past. The data and the corresponding label is shown in the table below.

| $x$ | $y$ |
|---|---|
| [0, 1, 1] | 0 |
| [1, 0, 1] | 1 |
| [1, 0, 0] | 1 |
| [1, 1, 1] | 1 |

Compute the zero-one error of the model if they have used 
$$
u(z) = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{for } z \ge 0 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
and $z = 0.5x_1 - 0.8x_2 + 0.4x_3$
