Consider this dimensionality reduction problem, the encoder and decoder functions expressed as $f(x) = x_1 + x_2 - x_3$ and $g(u) = [u,-u,u]$ respectively are used to reduce the dimension of the data set given below

$x$
|  |
| - |
| [-1, 1, -1] |
| [1, 2, 1] |
| [1, 1, -1] |
| [0, 1, 3] |

What is the mean reconstruction error obtained for the model?

Find the value of a such that $f(x)$ is continuous at $x = 0$:
$f(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{\sqrt{1 + ax} - \sqrt{1 - ax}}{x}, & \text{if } -1 \leq x < 0 \\
\frac{2x + 1}{x - 1}, & \text{if } 0 \leq x < 1 
\end{cases}$
