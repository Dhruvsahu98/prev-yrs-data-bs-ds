Question Label : Short Answer Question

The ML team in a movie production company wanted to predict whether a movie will earn 100 cr or not by using some classification models. Therefore, the team collected presence/absence of various factors $X = [x_1, x_2, x_3]$ from the movies in the past. The data and the corresponding labels are shown in the Table below.

|  X  |  y  |
|:---:|:---:|
| [0,1,1] | 0 |
| [1,0,1] | 1 |
| [1,0,0] | 1 |
| [1,1,1] | 1 |
| [1,1,0] | 1 |

Compute the loss of the model if they use
$u(z) = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if } z \geq 0 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$
and $z = 0.5x_1 - 0.8x_2 + 0.4x_3$
