At the point $P_0 = (1, 2)$, the function $f(x, y)$ has a derivative of $2\sqrt{2}$ in the direction $(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$ and a derivative of 5 in the direction $(0, 1)$. Find the derivative of $f(x, y)$ at point $P_0$ in the direction $(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}})$. Enter the answer correct to two decimal places.
