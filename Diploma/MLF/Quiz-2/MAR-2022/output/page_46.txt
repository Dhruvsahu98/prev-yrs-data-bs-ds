We have a dataset which has only numerical features. We are implementing the following model on this dataset. (Note: X and y are feature matrix and label vector respectively.)

```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import CategoricalNB
model = CategoricalNB()
model.fit(X, y)
```

We find that the performance of the model is unsatisfactory. Which of the following models may be useful to use instead of CategoricalNB?

**Options :**
A.  ❌  NumericalNB
B.  ❌  MultinomialNB
C.  ❌  BernoulliNB
D.  ✅  GaussianNB
