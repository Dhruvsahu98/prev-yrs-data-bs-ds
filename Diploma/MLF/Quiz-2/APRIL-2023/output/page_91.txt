Which of the following are the limitations of PCA?
Options :
6406531736885. ❌  PCA does work well for non-linearly correlated data.
6406531736886. ✅  PCA always consider the low variance components in the data as noise and recommend us to throw away those components. But, sometimes those components play a major role in a supervised learning task.
6406531736887. ✅  If the variables are correlated, PCA can achieve dimension reduction. If not, PCA just orders them according to their variances.
6406531736888. ✅  PCA always finds orthogonal principal components. Sometimes, our data demands non-orthogonal principal components to represent the data.
