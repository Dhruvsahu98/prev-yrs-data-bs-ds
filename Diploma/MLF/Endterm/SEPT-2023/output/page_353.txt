5. Likelihood of i.i.d. samples: Likelihood of a sampling \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \), denoted
\[ L(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i; \theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots) \]

6. Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation:
\[ \hat{\theta}_1, \hat{\theta}_2, \ldots = \arg \max_{\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots} \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i; \theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots) \]

Which of the following statements accurately describes the key difference between classification and regression models?

Options :

6406532034439. ❋ In classification, the output variable is continuous and real-valued, while in regression, it is categorical.

6406532034440. ❋ Regression models are used for predicting probabilities, whereas classification models focus on predicting absolute values.

6406532034441. ✔ Classification models aim to find decision boundaries to separate data into classes, while regression models seek to predict a numeric value.
