Stephen Fleming hired a ML team to predict whether CSK will be successful or not in winning IPL 2022 by using some classification models. Therefore the team collected presence/absence of various factors \( x = [x_1, x_2, x_3] \) from both successful and unsuccessful year in past. The data and the corresponding label is shown in the table below.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
x & y \\
\hline
[0, 1, 1] & 1 \\
[1, 0, 0] & 1 \\
[1, 1, 1] & 1 \\
[1, 1, 1] & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Compute the zero-one error of the model if they have used

\[
u(z) = \begin{cases} 
1, & \text{for } z \geq 0 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

and \( z = 0.5x_1 - 0.8x_2 + 0.4x_3 \)

NOTE: Enter your answer in two decimal places.
