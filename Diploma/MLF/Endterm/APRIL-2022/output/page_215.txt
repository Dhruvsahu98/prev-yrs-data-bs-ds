Each throw of an unfair die lands on the odd numbers with probability \(p\) and lands on the even numbers with probability \(2p\). Let

\[
X = \begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if the throw results in an even number} \\
0, & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
\]

and

\[
Y = \begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if the throw results in an odd number} \\
0, & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
\]

Find the value of \(f_{XY}(1, 0)\). Enter the answer correct to two decimal places.
