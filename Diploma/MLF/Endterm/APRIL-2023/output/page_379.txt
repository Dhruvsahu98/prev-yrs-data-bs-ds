Let \( p \) denote the proportion of voters who support Candidate A for the post of college president. Randomly \( n \) selected voters are interviewed, and the fraction who are in favour of candidate A is recorded. Using Chebyshev inequality, find the minimum number of voters who should be interviewed such that the probability that sample mean is within 0.01 of \( p \) with probability at least 0.95. Enter the answer as integer.

Hint: If \( X \in [a, b] \), population variance \( \leq \frac{(b - a)^2}{4} \).
