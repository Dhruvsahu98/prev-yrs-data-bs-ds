A student wants to purchase a snack from a bakery to meet certain dietary requirements by chossing the best combination of brownies and cheesecake. The student is following some new diet trend which requires her to eat maximum of 6 brownies and maximum of 10 cakes. Also total number of brownies and cakes together the student eats should be greater than 12. The cost of 1 piece of brownie($x_1$) and 1 piece of cake($x_2$) is 50 units and 80 units respectively. Her goal is to satisfy these requirements at minimal cost.

\textbf{Options :}
