Let \( A \) and \( B \) be two matrices such that reduced echelon form of \( A \) and \( B \) are the same. Then \( \text{rank}(A) > \text{rank}(B) \).

Let \( Ax = 0 \) be a system of linear equations such that reduced echelon form of the coefficient matrix \( A \) is the identity matrix. Then the system \( Ax = 0 \) has infinitely many solutions.
