Consider the following regression problem with one dimensional feature where the data is really generated according to the following rules (but the learning algorithm does not know these rules). 

\[ X \sim \text{Normal}(5,5) \]

\[ Y = X + 5 \]

Using \( n \) data points, your learning algorithm outputs a learned model \( f(x) = X + 3 \). What is the MSE (mean squared error) of the output model?
