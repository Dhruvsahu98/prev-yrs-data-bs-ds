Which of the following statements about kernel PCA is/are always true?

**Options :**

6406531932425. ❌ The number of principal components corresponding to nonzero eigenvalues obtained using kernel PCA on d dimensional dataset cannot be more than d.

6406531932426. ✅ For every transformation mapping $\phi: R^d \rightarrow R^D$, there exists a valid kernel function.

6406531932427. ✅ For two valid kernels $k_1, k_2: R^d \times R^d \rightarrow R$, $ak_1 + bk_2$ is a valid kernel function. Here both $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers.
