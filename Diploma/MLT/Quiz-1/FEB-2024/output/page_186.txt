Consider a dataset with 100 total data points. Each data point is classified as either type A or type B. We model this using a Bernoulli distribution, where $p$ is the probability of a data point being type A. If the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of $p$ based on the dataset is 0.4, how many data points of type B are there in this dataset?
