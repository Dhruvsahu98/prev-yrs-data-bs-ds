Consider a centered dataset of 1000 points in $\mathbb{R}^{10}$. Standard PCA is performed on this dataset. What is the maximum number of principal components that can be retained so that the compression ratio does not fall below 1/4 ? The compression ratio is defined as:
$\frac{size \ of \ original \ dataset}{size \ of \ reconstructed \ dataset}$
Assume that each real number occupies one unit of storage space. Note that we are interested in the reconstructions and not just in the scalar projections. So, the reconstructed dataset will also be in $\mathbb{R}^{10}$.
