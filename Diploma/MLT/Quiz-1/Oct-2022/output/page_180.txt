Assume that you have a dataset of four points $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}$, all of which lie in $[0, 1]$. You hypothesise that the data points are iid random variables with the following density:
 $$
 f(x; \theta) = 
 \begin{cases}
 \theta x^{\theta - 1}, & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
 0, & \text{otherwise}
 \end{cases}
 $$
Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
