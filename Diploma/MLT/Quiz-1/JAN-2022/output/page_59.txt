For the given dataset:

| x | y |
|---|---|
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 8 |

For fitting linear regression model, assume the initial weight vector is $w = [0, 0]$ and learning rate $\alpha = 0.01$. Compute the weight vector after one iteration, let's call it $w_1$. Compute prediction for $x = 5$ correct upto two decimal points with new weight vector (i.e. $w_1$). Do not round up or off.

Ankita had a feature vector x and she wanted to apply polynomial transformation on x. She had written a code snippet as follows:

```python
import itertools, functools
import numpy as np
x = np.array([[2, 3]])
degree = 3
x_t = x.transpose()
features = [np.ones(len(x))]
for degree in range(1, degree + 1):
  for items in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(x_t, degree):
    features.append(functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, items))
output = np.sum(np.asarray(features).transpose())
print(int(output))
```

What is the output of the code snippet?
