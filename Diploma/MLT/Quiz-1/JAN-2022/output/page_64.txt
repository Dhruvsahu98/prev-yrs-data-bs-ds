Rahul used cross-validation procedure and trained different lasso regression models with various regularization rate $\lambda$ values on some non-linear dataset. The plot of $\lambda$ vs cross-validation errors (RMSE) is given below.

By inspecting the plot, Rahul came to a set of conclusions as mentioned below:
i. The most appropriate value of $\lambda$ is 0.001.
ii. The models with $1e^{-06} \leq \lambda \leq 0.0001$ may also smoothly fit the data.
iii. The models with 0.01 $ < \lambda \leq 1$ do not fit the data.

What can you say about his conclusions?

$\lambda$ vs Cross validation error

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
\hline
Cross validation error (on log scale) & 100.0 & 10.0 & 1.0 & 0.1 & 0.01 \\ \hline
$\lambda$ (on log scale) & 0 & 1e-08 & 1e-07 & 1e-06 & 1e-05 & 0.0001 & 0.001 & 0.01 & 0.1 & 1 & 10 & 100 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
