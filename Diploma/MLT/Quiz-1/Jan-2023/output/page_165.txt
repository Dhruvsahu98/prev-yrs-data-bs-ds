Consider a centered dataset in $\mathbb{R}^{100}$ that has 1000 data-points. Call this dataset $D_1$. Standard PCA is performed on $D_1$ and the scalar projections of $D_1$ on the top 5 principal components are computed. Call the resulting dataset $D_2$.

NOTE: $D_2$ is only made up of the scalar projections. All the principal components are thrown out after computing the scalar projections and are not a part of $D_2$.

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
