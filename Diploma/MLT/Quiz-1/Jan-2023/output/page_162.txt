With respect to the Lloyd's algorithm, choose the correct statements:

Options :
6406531563114. ✅ The partition configurations cannot repeat themselves.
6406531563115. ❌ After doing the reassignments (consider at least one point reassigned to the new cluster), we might get the same means for all clusters.
6406531563116. ✅ Objective function after making the re-assignments strictly reduces.
6406531563117. ❌ Objective function after making the re-assignments may increase.
6406531563118. ✅ A change in the objective function's value indicates that the partition configuration has changed.
6406531563119. ❌ For partitioning n data points across k partitions, Lloyd's algorithm takes $k^n$ iterations to converge.
