A GMM is fit for a dataset with 5 points. At some time-step in the EM algorithm, the following are the values of $\lambda_k$ for all points in the dataset for the $k^{th}$ mixture after the E-step:
$\lambda_k^1 = 0.3, \lambda_k^2 = 0.1, \lambda_k^3 = 0.5, \lambda_k^4 = 0.5, \lambda_k^5 = 0.3$
What is the estimate of $\pi_k$ after the M-step? Enter your answer correct to two decimal places.
