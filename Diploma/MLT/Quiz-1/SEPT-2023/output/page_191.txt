Suppose that we have a dataset (data matrix) $X \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$, where $d$ denotes the number of features and $n$ denotes the number of samples. Assume that $d >> n$ and the data is centered. The representative line is given by the unit vector, pointing in the direction of the line, w. 
In all the cases, we maximize the objective function given below 

$f(w) = w^T C w$

where $C = \frac{1}{n} X X^T$ is a covariance matrix. The kernel matrix is defined to be $K = X^T X$. 

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
