In the K-means algorithm, cluster centroids ($\mu_k$) are updated at each iteration to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned centroids. The formula used for this update is: 

$\mu_k = \frac{\sum x_i 1(z_i = k)}{\sum 1(z_i = k)}$

Here: 

- $x_i$ represents $i^{th}$ data point in the dataset.
- $z_i$ represents the cluster assignment for data point $x_i$, where $z_i$ is an integer indicating the cluster index ($k$).

Suppose you have a dataset of 9 two-dimensional data points and are performing K-means clustering with $K = 3$ clusters. After the first iteration, clusters $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$ have the following data points:

$C_1$: {(2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)}
$C_2$: {(6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8)}
$C_3$: {(10, 10), (11, 11), (12, 12)}

After the second iteration, which of the following options represents the updated cluster centroid $\mu_k$ for $C_1$ using the provided formula?

**Options :**

6406532240047. $\mu_1 = (2.5, 2.5)$ 
6406532240048. $\mu_1 = (4.5, 4.5)$
6406532240049. $\mu_1 = (3, 3)$
6406532240050. $\mu_1 = (5.5, 5.5)$
