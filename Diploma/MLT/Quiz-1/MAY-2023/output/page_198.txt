Consider a dataset with 60 points in which all points are either 0 or 1. We use a Bernoulli distribution with the parameter $p$ to model this problem. The prior and posterior distributions for the parameter $p$ are Beta(10,5) and Beta(30,45) respectively. How many data points have the value 0 in this dataset? Note that $p = P(x = 1)$ as usual.
