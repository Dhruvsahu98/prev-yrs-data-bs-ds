Standard PCA has been performed on a centered dataset in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
The first two principal components are given below:
$W_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$, $W_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
Consider the following data-point in the dataset:
$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}^T$. $(a, b)$ is the representation of this point in the coordinate system formed by the two principal components given above. The first and second coordinates correspond to PC-1 and PC-2 respectively.
Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
