Consider a supervised ML problem that has a training dataset and a validation dataset. A ML model is being trained on the training dataset using gradient descent and its performance is monitored on the validation dataset. The loss function \( L(t) \) at time step \( t \) is plotted against \( t \).

\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    xlabel={$t$},
    ylabel={$L(t)$},
    ymin=0, ymax=120,
    xmin=0, xmax=10,
    ytick={0,20,40,60,80,100},
    xtick={0,2,4,6,8,10}
]
\addplot[
    domain=0:10, 
    samples=100, 
    color=black,
]
{100 / (x + 1)};
\addlegendentry{(1)}

\addplot[
    domain=0:10, 
    samples=100, 
    color=black,
    dashed
]
{50 / (x + 1)};
\addlegendentry{(2)}

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\]

One of these curves corresponds to the model’s loss on the training dataset and the other corresponds to the model’s loss on the validation dataset. Identify the two curves. Consider a general scenario and not an extreme instance while answering this problem. Exactly two options are correct.

Options :
6406531891887. ✔ (1) is the loss on the validation dataset
6406531891888. ✔ (2) is the loss on the training dataset
6406531891889. ✖ (1) is the loss on the training dataset
6406531891890. ✖ (2) is the loss on the validation dataset
