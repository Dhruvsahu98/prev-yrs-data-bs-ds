Consider a logistic regression model that has been trained for a binary classification problem on a dataset in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $. Consider two data-points from the training set: $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. The model's weight vector and these two data-points (along with their labels) are drawn in the diagram given below. The symbol $ + $ corresponds to label 1 and $ - $ corresponds to label 0.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[->] (-4,0) -- (4,0) node[right] {$x_1$};
    \draw[->] (0,-4) -- (0,4) node[above] {$x_2$};
    \draw (-3,-3) -- (3,3);
    \node at (2, 2.5) {$x_1$};
    \node at (-2, -2.5) {$x_2$};
    \node at (1, 1.5) {$w$};
    \node at (2, 3) {$-$};
    \node at (-2, -3) {$+$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

$ \sigma_1 $ and $ \sigma_2 $ are the probabilities output by the model for the two data-points. If $ |\sigma_1 - y_1| $ and $ |\sigma_2 - y_2| $ are treated as the errors in prediction for the two data-points, compute the following quantity:

\[
\frac{|\sigma_1 - y_1|}{|\sigma_2 - y_2|}
\]

Note that the probability output by a logistic regression model is $ P(y = 1 \mid x) $. The figure is drawn to scale and you can use it to get the required values. Enter the nearest positive integer as your answer
