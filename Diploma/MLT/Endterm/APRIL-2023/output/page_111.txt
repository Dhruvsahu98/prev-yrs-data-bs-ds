Consider a Bayesian estimation problem for a dataset of six observations, where each observation is either one or zero. The prior (green) and posterior (blue) distributions are shown below. Recall that both are Beta distributions in this case. \( p \) denotes the parameter and \( f(p) \) denotes its pdf. Also recall that the observations are sampled from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter \( p \).
