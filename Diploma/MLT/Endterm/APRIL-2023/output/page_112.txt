Consider a decision stump. The information gain for the question at the parent is zero. If the entropy of the left-child is equal to the entropy of the parent, what is the entropy of the right child? Assume that each child has at least one data-point in it and that the entropy of the parent is non-zero.

Options :

6406531891851. The entropy of the right-child is equal to half the entropy of the left-child.

6406531891852. The entropy of the right-child is equal to twice the entropy of the left-child.

6406531891853. The entropy of the right-child is equal to the entropy of the parent.

6406531891854. The entropy of the right-child is the sum of the entropies of the parent and the left-child.
