Question Label: Comprehension

Consider the following two-dimensional dataset with two classes:
+1 for blue points and -1 for red points. An AdaBoost algorithm
was run on this dataset using decision stumps as weak learners.

\[
\begin{array}{cc}
X_2 & \\
4 & \\
3 & \\
2 & \\
1 & \\
0 & 1 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad X_1
\end{array}
\]

When training the new weak learner \( h_t(x) \) (decision stump at \( t^{th} \) iteration),
we choose the split that minimizes the weighted misclassification error with
respect to current weights \( D_t \) i.e. choose \( h_t \) that minimizes

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_t(i) 1(h_t(x_i) \neq y_i)
\]

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
