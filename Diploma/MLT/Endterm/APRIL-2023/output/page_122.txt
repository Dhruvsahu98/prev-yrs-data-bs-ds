Consider the \( K \)-means algorithm was run on the following two-dimensional dataset with \( K = 3 \). The initial cluster centroids are points A, B, and D as shown in the figure.

\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
   &  &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
   &  &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
   &  &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
   &  &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
   &  &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
   &  &  &  &  &  &  &  \\
\end{array}
\]

How many cluster centroids in the final clusters will be the same as the initial cluster centroids? Use Euclidean distance to calculate the distance.
