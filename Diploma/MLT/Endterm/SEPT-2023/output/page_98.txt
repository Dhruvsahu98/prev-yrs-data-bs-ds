Which of the following statements is/are true?
Options :
6406532033432.  ✓ Ridge regression and Lasso regression both puts a limit on the length of weight vector.
6406532033433.  ✗ Ridge regression puts limit on length of the weight vector but LASSO regression does not put a limit on weight vector length.
6406532033434.  ✓ When many features are redundant, then LASSO regression is more appropriate than ridge regression and linear regression as LASSO regression produces sparse weights for those features.
