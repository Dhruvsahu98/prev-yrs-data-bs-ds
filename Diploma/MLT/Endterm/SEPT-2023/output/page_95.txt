Suppose you have been given a task of estimating the conversion rate of google click of new online advertisement campaign. You have collected data from a limited sample of 1000 users, where 150 of them have converted. You want to use Bayesian estimation with a prior distribution to provide a more robust estimate of the conversion rate.

Assume you have prior information suggesting that conversion rates of click typically fall within the range of 0.1 to 0.3, and you decide to use a beta distribution as your prior. You choose a beta distribution with parameters $\alpha = 5$ and $\beta = 20$ to capture your prior beliefs.
