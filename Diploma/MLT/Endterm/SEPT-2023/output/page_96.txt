You are working on a text classification problem using a Naive Bayes classifier to determine whether an email is "Spam" or "Not Spam". You have trained your model using a dataset of 1000 emails, with 600 of them labeled as "Spam" and 400 labeled as "Not Spam." You've collected statistics on the occurrence of two words, "Won" and "Money" in these emails:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Keyword} & \text{label of email} & \text{Probability} \\
\hline
\text{Won} & \text{Spam} & P(\text{Won}|\text{Spam}) = 0.45 \\
\hline
\text{Won} & \text{Not Spam} & P(\text{Won}|\text{Not Spam}) = 0.05 \\
\hline
\text{Money} & \text{Spam} & P(\text{Money}|\text{Spam}) = 0.3 \\
\hline
\text{Money} & \text{Not Spam} & P(\text{Money}|\text{Not Spam}) = 0.02 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

You receive a new email containing both the "Won" and "Money" keywords and want to classify it using Naive Bayes.

Use the Naive Bayes formula to calculate the probability that the new email is classified as "Spam."

Hint: Assume that these are only two possible words (that is there are only two features)
