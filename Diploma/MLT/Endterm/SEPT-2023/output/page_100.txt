In a random forest model, let $p < d$ be the number of randomly selected features that are used to identify the best split at any node of a tree. Here $d$ is the total number of features. Which of the following is/are true?

Options :
6406532033463. ❌ Increasing $p$ reduces the correlation between any two trees in the forest.
6406532033464. ✅ Decreasing $p$ reduces the correlation between any two trees in the forest.
6406532033465. ✅ Decreasing $p$ will underfit individual trees in the forest.
6406532033466. ✅ As the value of $p$ increases variance of the random forest model increases.
