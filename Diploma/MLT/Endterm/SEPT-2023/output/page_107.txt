Consider a simple neural network with one hidden layer. The network has the following architecture:
Input layer with 3 neurons.
Hidden layer with 2 neurons, using the sigmoid activation function.
Output layer with 1 neuron, using the linear activation function.
The weights and biases for the network are as follows:
Hidden Layer:
Neuron 1:
Weights: [0.5, -0.2, 0.8]
Bias: 0.1
Neuron 2:
Weights: [-0.3, 0.6, -0.7]
Bias: -0.4
Output Layer:
Neuron 1:
Weights: [0.2, 0.4]
Bias: -0.3
Assume that the input values are [0.6, 0.3, 0.8].
Calculate output of Neuron 1 in hidden layer
