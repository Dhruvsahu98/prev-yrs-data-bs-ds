# You are working on a binary classification problem where you need to predict whether an email is spam (1) or not (0). You have trained a machine learning model that produces predicted probabilities for each email being spam. You have two different loss functions to consider: the 0-1 loss and the squared loss.

# You have a test dataset with the following true labels and predicted probabilities for a set of emails:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Email} & \text{True label} & \text{Predicted probability} \\
\hline
1 & 0 & 0.8 \\
\hline
2 & 1 & 0.2 \\
\hline
3 & 0 & 0.6 \\
\hline
4 & 1 & 0.9 \\
\hline
5 & 1 & 0.3 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

# For the given data set if Predicted probability is greater than 0.5, the predicted label will be 1 and 0 otherwise.

# Options :

# 6406532033468. The values of 0-1 loss function will be 3
