You are working on a binary classification problem where you need to predict whether an email is spam (1) or not (0). You have trained a machine learning model that produces predicted probabilities for each email being spam. You have two different loss functions to consider: the 0-1 loss and the squared loss.

You have a test dataset with the following true labels and predicted probabilities for a set of emails:

| Email | True label | Predicted probability |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 0.8 |
| 2 | 1 | 0.2 |
| 3 | 0 | 0.6 |
| 4 | 1 | 0.9 |
| 5 | 1 | 0.3 |

For the given data set if Predicted probability is greater than 0.5, the predicted label will be 1 and 0 otherwise. 

Options : 

640653203468. The values of 0-1 loss function will be 3
