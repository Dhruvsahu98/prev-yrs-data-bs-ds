Which among the following are some of the differences between bagging and boosting?

Options :
A. ✵ In bagging we use the same classification algorithm for training on each sample of the data, whereas in boosting, we use different classification algorithms on the different training data samples
B. ✔ Bagging is easy to parallelise whereas boosting is inherently a sequential process
