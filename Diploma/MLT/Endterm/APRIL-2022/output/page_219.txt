Instructions:
1. Always add dummy feature in the beginning of feature matrix where necessary.
2. Do NOT write your answers as percentages. E.g. if your answer is computed to be 12%, then type 0.12.
3. Answers are case sensitive.
4. Do NOT include single or double quotes in your typed answers.

Useful Data

Logistic Regression
Inference using logistic regression happens as follows: $T$ is called the threshold and is some real number in the interval $(0,1)$. $\hat{y}$ stands for the predicted label.
 $$
 \hat{y} = 
  \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if } P(y = 1|x) \geq T \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
 $$

The threshold is usually set to 0.5 unless otherwise specified.

Multivariate Guassian Distribution
$x$ is a vector of size $m$, $\mu$ is the mean vector of size $m$, $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of size $m \times m$. The PDF is given by:
 $$
 p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^m|\Sigma|}}exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(x - \mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x - \mu)\right)
 $$

If $m = 2$, then this is called a bi-variate Gaussian distribution.
