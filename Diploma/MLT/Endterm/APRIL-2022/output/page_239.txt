Consider a multi-class classification problem with \( m \) classes. The feature vector is of size \( m \). You donâ€™t need to add any dummy feature as we will be working with a neural network.

The network has \( h \) hidden layers, each having \( m \) neurons. So, the network architecture would be a list of size \( h+2 \), where all the elements are equal to \( m \): \([m, \cdots, m]\)

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
