Consider the feature matrix $X_{2 \times 4}$ (first/leftmost column represents dummy feature) and corresponding label vector $y_{2 \times 1}$ in the below table. Let regularization rate, $\lambda = 0.1$.

|   | X | y |
|---|---|---|
|   | [1, 1, 2, 3] | 2 |
|   | [1, 3, 2, 4] | 4 |

We want to cluster 9 observations into 3 clusters using K-Means clustering algorithm. After the first iteration, clusters C1, C2 and C3 have the following samples:

C1: (1, 1), (1, 3), (4, 2)
C2: (0, 4), (4, 0), (0.5, 0.5)
C3: (5, 5), (9, 9), (1, 4)

What will be the cluster centroids if you want to proceed for the second iteration?
