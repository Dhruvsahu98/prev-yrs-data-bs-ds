Question Label : Multiple Select Question

We wish to classify a set of data-points in 2D space. Unfortunately, we donâ€™t have access to the 
labels. Though not very accurate, one approach is to first cluster the points using K-means 
algorithm and then build a Naive Bayes classifier using the cluster labels as the class labels.

Let us use \( k = 2 \) for K-means. Upon execution, the algorithm gives us two clusters with labels 1 and 
2, and centroids \( \alpha_1 \) and \( \alpha_2 \) respectively. Both are vectors of length 2. A Gaussian NB model is fit on 
this data. If \( \mu_1 \) and \( \mu_2 \) are the estimated means of the bi-variate Gaussian distribution for classes 1 
and 2, which of the following statements are true?

Options :
A. \(\mu_1 = \alpha_1\)
B. \(\mu_2 = \alpha_2\)
C. \(\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2\)
D. \(\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \frac{\alpha_1 + \alpha_2}{2}\)
E. \(\mu_1 = \frac{\alpha_1}{2}\)
F. \(\mu_2 = \frac{\alpha_2}{2}\)

\begin{equation}
A. \quad \mu_1 = \alpha_1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
B. \quad \mu_2 = \alpha_2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C. \quad \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
D. \quad \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \frac{\alpha_1 + \alpha_2}{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
E. \quad \mu_1 = \frac{\alpha_1}{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
F. \quad \mu_2 = \frac{\alpha_2}{2}
\end{equation}
