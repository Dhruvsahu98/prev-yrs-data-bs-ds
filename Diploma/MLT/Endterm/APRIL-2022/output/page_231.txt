Question Label : Multiple Select Question

We wish to classify a set of data-points in 2D space. Unfortunately, we don't have access to the labels. Though not very accurate, one approach is to first cluster the points using K-means algorithm and then build a Naive Bayes classifier using the cluster labels as the class labels.

Let us use $k=2$ for K-means. Upon execution, the algorithm gives us two clusters with labels 1 and 2, and centroids $a_1$ and $a_2$ respectively. Both are vectors of length 2. A Gaussian NB model is fit on this data. If $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are the estimated means of the bi-variate Gaussian distribution for classes 1 and 2, which of the following statements are true?

Options :
A. $\checkmark$ $\mu_1 = a_1$
B. $\checkmark$ $\mu_2 = a_2$
C. $\times$ $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = a_1 + a_2$
D. $\times$ $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \frac{a_1 + a_2}{2}$
E. $\times$ $\mu_1 = \frac{a_1}{2}$
F. $\times$ $\mu_2 = \frac{a_2}{2}$
