Consider that the AdaBoost model is trained on the following binary classification dataset.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
X_1 & X_2 & \text{Label (y)} \\
\hline
2 & 5 & \text{true} \\
2.5 & 6 & \text{false} \\
3 & 5 & \text{true} \\
4 & 3 & \text{false} \\
4 & 4 & \text{false} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The data-set is split according to the feature \( X_1 \) to create the first stump. Equal sample weights are assigned to each example to create the first stump and the Gini-index measure is used to split the data.

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
