Consider that the AdaBoost model is trained on the following binary classification dataset.

| $X_1$ | $X_2$ | Label ($y$) |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | 5 | true |
| 2.5 | 6 | false |
| 3 | 5 | true |
| 4 | 3 | false |
| 4 | 4 | false |

The data-set is split according to the feature $X_1$ to create the first stump. Equal sample weights are assigned to each example to create the first stump and the Gini-index measure is used to split the data.

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
