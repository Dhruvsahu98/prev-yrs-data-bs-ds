The MNIST digit classification problem has 10 classes. The training dataset has \(n\) data points, with an equal number of points from each of the 10 classes. Consider a dummy classifier that does prediction as follows: for each input data-point, it picks one of the 10 classes at random (uniformly) and outputs that as its prediction. What is the accuracy of the model on the training dataset as \(n\)
