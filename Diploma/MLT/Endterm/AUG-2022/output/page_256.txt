Inference using logistic regression happens as follows. $T$ is called the threshold and is some real number in the interval $(0,1)$. $\hat{y}$ stands for the predicted label. 
$$
\hat{y} = \begin{cases}
1, & P(\hat{y}=1|x) \ge T \\
0, & otherwise
\end{cases}
$$
Given this setup, the equation of the decision boundary is given below: 
$$
w^T x - u = 0
$$
w has the same dimensions as x. The dummy feature is included in x and the corresponding weight is included in w. If $T = \frac{e}{1+e}$, what is the value of the unknown quantity $u$? Here, $e$ is Euler's number that is associated with the natural logarithm and is the same one found on your calculator. Enter the closest integer as your answer.
