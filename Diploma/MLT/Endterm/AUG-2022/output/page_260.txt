Consider the following training data-set with three features:
\(X_1\) = Present price of the car (values are given in lac)
\(X_2\) = Age (How many years the car has been driven)
\(X_3\) = Fuel-type (diesel or LPG)

\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
X_1 & X_2 & X_3 & \text{Selling price } (y) \\
\hline
7.7 & 5 & \text{Diesel} & 4.5 \\
6.5 & 6 & \text{Diesel} & 2.0 \\
11.2 & 5 & \text{LPG} & 7.0 \\
8.4 & 3 & \text{Diesel} & 6.0 \\
5.0 & 4 & \text{LPG} & 2.5 \\
7.5 & 3 & \text{LPG} & 4.5 \\
10.0 & 5 & \text{LPG} & 6.5 \\
18.0 & 5 & \text{Diesel} & 12.0 \\
12.1 & 8 & \text{Diesel} & 6.0 \\
7.5 & 6 & \text{Diesel} & 3.0 \\
\end{array}
\]

Its regression tree is given below. In the tree, each node is denoted by the feature along which it is split.

\[
\begin{array}{c}
  & X_1 \\
  & \leq 7.5 & \quad & > 7.5 \\
  & / & \quad & \backslash \\
X_2 \leq 5 & \quad & X_2 > 5 & \quad & X_3 \\
/ & \quad & \backslash & \quad & / & \quad & \backslash \\
\text{Leaf 1} & \quad & X_1 \leq 6.5 & \quad & X_1 > 6.5 & \quad & \text{Diesel} & \quad & \text{LPG} \\
& \quad & / & \quad & \backslash & \quad & \text{Leaf 4} & \quad & \text{Leaf 5} \\
& \quad & \text{Leaf 2} & \quad & \text{Leaf 3} \\
\end{array}
