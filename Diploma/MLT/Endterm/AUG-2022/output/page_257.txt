An SVM has been trained for a 2D problem. The feature vector is $\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix}$.
It has the following weight vector and bias:

$\mathbf{w} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$, $b = -1$

Recall that the labels in the SVM setup are +1 and -1. Consider a unit square whose vertices are at:

(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)

The horizontal axis corresponds to $x_1$ and the vertical axis corresponds to $x_2$. A point is picked at random (uniformly) from the region bounded by the square. What is the probability that this point is predicted as belonging to class +1 by the SVM? Enter your answer correct to two decimal places.
