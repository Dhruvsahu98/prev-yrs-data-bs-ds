Find the hinge loss for this soft-margin SVM classifier on the dataset that is given in the table. The weight vector and bias are as follows:

\[
w = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad b = 1
\]

The coefficient \(C\) can be assumed to be 1.

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
x_1 & x_2 & y \\
1 & 4 & -1 \\
-1 & 2 & -1 \\
0 & -1 & 1 \\
3 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
2 & 1 & 1 \\
2 & 3 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\]

Note that you just need to report the hinge loss. Do not compute margin loss which involves only the term \(w\). Also, note that the hinge loss does not have a factor of 0.5 before it. Enter the closest integer as your answer.
