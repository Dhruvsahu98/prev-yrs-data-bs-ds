A perceptron model is trained on the following binary classification data-set.

| $X_1$ | $X_2$ | Label ($y$) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | -1 |
| 0 | 1 | -1 |
| 1 | 0 | -1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

At one of the iterations, weights are : $w_0 = -0.5$, $w_1 = 0.9$ and $w_2 = 0.9$. Assume that $w_0'$, $w_1'$ and $w_2'$ are the updated weights after one epoch (one epoch is completed on going through all the data points). Find the value of $w_0' + w_1' + w_2'$. Consider the learning rate to be one. Don't change the order of samples while updating the weight vector. Take the original order of samples.
