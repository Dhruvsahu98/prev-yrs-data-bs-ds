Consider the following code snippet that employs LogisticRegression from sklearn on a feature matrix X and corresponding label vector y:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced', C=0.5)
model.fit(X, y)
```

Given the code above, which of the following statements is true?

Options :

6406532577803. $\times$ The logistic regression model will give equal importance to both classes in an imbalanced dataset.

6406532577804. $\times$ The model does not use any regularization because the parameter C is set.

6406532577805. $\times$ The model will perform equally well on both imbalanced and balanced datasets due to the class_weight parameter. 

6406532577806. $\checkmark$ The value of C indicates that the model will apply a regularization.
