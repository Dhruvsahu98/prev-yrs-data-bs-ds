An AI engine to scrutinize applications for the BS program is being developed. The aim of the AI engine is to shortlist applicants who have the highest chance of completing the program. Hence, the AI engine classifies every applicant as either "Selected" or "Not Selected" based on the "Probability of Completion" which is computed using an applicant's previous academic and professional records (X mark, XII mark, work experience, conduct and number of extracurricular certificates)

To test the model, past student data was captured. Using the past data, the AI model predicted the probability for completion. This is provided in Table-2. The table also provides the information of whether the student actually completed the course.Given this information, answer the subquestions.

| Student ID | Probability for the student to complete the course | Did the student actually complete the course |
