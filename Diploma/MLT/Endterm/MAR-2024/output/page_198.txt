classification task. You decide to use a pipeline that includes data preprocessing and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The following code snippet demonstrates the pipeline creation and usage:
```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Simulated data (features: X, target: y)
X = np.array([[2, 3], [5, 7], [8, 10]])
y = np.array([0, 1, 0])

# Create a pipeline with StandardScaler and SVM classifier
pipeline = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), 
                     ('svm', SVC())])

# Fit the pipeline on training data
pipeline.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions using the trained pipeline
predictions = pipeline.predict(X)
```

What is the purpose of using the pipeline in this code snippet?

**Options :**
 6406532577783. 	 The pipeline combines multiple models for better model performance.
 6406532577784. 	 The pipeline allows for simultaneous training of the scaler and classifier.
 6406532577785. $\checkmark$ The pipeline simplifies the code by encapsulating preprocessing and modeling steps.
 6406532577786. 	 The pipeline ensures that only linear SVM can be used for this classification task.
