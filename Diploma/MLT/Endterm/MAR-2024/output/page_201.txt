Consider the following code snippet using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

pipeline = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                   ('classifier', SVC())])

param_grid = {'scaler__with_mean': [True, False],
              'classifier__C': [0.1, 1, 10],
              'classifier__kernel': ['linear', 'rbf'],
              'classifier__gamma': [0.1, 1, 10]}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator= pipeline,
                          param_grid= param_grid,
                          cv=5,
                          scoring= 'accuracy',
                          verbose=2)

grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Assuming that X_train and y_train are given and the features are not sparse, which of the following statements about the given code is correct?

Options :

6406532577799. $ \times $ The StandardScaler will scale both X_train and y_train before training a classifier. 

6406532577800. $ \checkmark $ All the classifiers will not be trained on the scaled data with zero mean and unit variance. 

6406532577801. $ \times $ The pipeline always uses a radial basis function ('rbf') as the kernel for the SVC() classifier.
