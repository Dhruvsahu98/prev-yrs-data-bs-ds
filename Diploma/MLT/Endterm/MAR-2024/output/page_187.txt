Kernel regression with a polynomial kernel of degree three is applied on a data set $\{X, y\}$. Let the weight vector be given by 
$w = \phi(X)[2.3, -1.0, 0.4, -0.7]^T$
Here $\phi(X)$ is the transformed data matrix whose $i^{th}$ column is $\phi(x_i)$. What will be the prediction for the data point $[0, 0, 0, 0]^T$?

Suppose you have a five-class classification problem where class label $y \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and each training example $x_i$ has binary features $f_1, f_2, f_3 \in \{0, 1\}$. How many parameters do we need to know to classify an example using Naive Bayes classifier?
