Consider a regression problem where you are tasked with predicting the sale prices of houses based on their square footage. You decide to experiment with two different models:

Model $P$ : $\hat{y_i} = w_0 + w_1 x$
Model $Q$ : $\hat{y_i} = w_0 + w_1 x + w_2 x^2$

The training dataset consists of information on 200 houses, and you use the models to make predictions on a test dataset of 50 houses. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is chosen as the evaluation metric.

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
