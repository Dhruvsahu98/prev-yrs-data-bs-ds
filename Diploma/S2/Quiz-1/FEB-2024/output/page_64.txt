The CDF of a random variable $X$ is given as
 $$
 F_X(x) = \begin{cases}
 1-e^{-4x}, & x \geq 0, \\
 0, & \text{otherwise}.
 \end{cases}
 $$

An analyst is responsible for conducting emissions inspections on bikes. During the inspections, the analyst found that 10% of the bikes fail the inspection. Let $X$ be a geometric variable which denotes the number of bikes the analyst inspects until a bike fails an inspection. Assume that the results of each inspection are independent.
