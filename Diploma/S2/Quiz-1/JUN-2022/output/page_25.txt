In a book store, there are two types of books (Type 1 and Type 2). Let $X$ denote the number of books of Type 1 that is sold in a week. Let $Y$ denote the number of books of Type 2 that is sold in a week. Suppose $X$ and $Y$ follows the Poisson distribution with parameters 2 and 3, respectively. Let $Z$ denote the total number of books of Type 1 and Type 2 sold in a week. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
