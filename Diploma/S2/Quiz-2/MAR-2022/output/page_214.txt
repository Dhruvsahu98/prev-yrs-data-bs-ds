At a particular petrol pump, petrol is stocked in a bulk tank each week. Let random variable X denote the proportion of the tank's capacity that is filled for a given week, and let Y denote the proportion of the tank's capacity that is sold in the same week. The petrol pump cannot sell more than what was stocked in a given week. Assume the joint density function of X and Y is given by
$$
f_{XY}(x,y) = \begin{cases}
c & \text{if } 0 \leq y \leq x \leq 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
