Suppose $X_1, X_2,..., X_9 \sim i.i.d. Poisson(\lambda)$. Let $\hat{\lambda}_1 = \frac{1}{8} \sum_{i=1}^{8} \frac{X_i + X_{i+1}}{2}$ and $\hat{\lambda}_2 = \frac{1}{9} \sum_{i=1}^{9} X_i + X_{i+1}$ be two estimators of $\lambda$. Which of the following statements are correct?
Options :
A. ❌ Both $\hat{\lambda}_1$ and $\hat{\lambda}_2$ are biased estimators of $\lambda$.
B. ✅ $\hat{\lambda}_1$ is an unbiased estimator of $\lambda$.
C. ❌ $\hat{\lambda}_2$ is an unbiased estimator of $\lambda$.
D. ✅ The variance of $\hat{\lambda}_1$ is $\frac{15 \lambda}{128}$.
E. ✅ The bias of $\hat{\lambda}_2$ is $\frac{-\lambda}{9}$.
