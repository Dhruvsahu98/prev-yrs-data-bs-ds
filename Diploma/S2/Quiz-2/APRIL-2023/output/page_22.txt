At a particular petrol pump, petrol is stocked in a bulk tank each week. Let a random variable X denote the proportion of the tank's capacity that is stocked in a given week, and let Y denote the proportion of the tank's capacity that is sold in the same week. The petrol pump cannot sell more than what was stocked in a given week. Assume the joint density function of X and Y is given by

$$f_{XY}(x,y) = \begin{cases}
cxy, & \text{if } 0 \leq y \leq x \leq 2, \\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
