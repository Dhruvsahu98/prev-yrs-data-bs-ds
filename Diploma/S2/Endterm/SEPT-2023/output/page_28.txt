An employee at a railway ticket counter serves customers in the queue individually. Suppose that the service time \(X_i\) for the \(i\)th customer has mean \(E[X_i] = 2\) and \(Var(X_i) = 1\). Assume that service times for different customers are independent. Let \(Y\) be the total time the employee spends to serve 100 customers.

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
