```python
The probability mass function of a discrete random variable \( X \) is given by

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
x & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline
f_X(x) & p & p & 1 - 2p \\
\end{array}
\]

Table 1

Consider 100 i.i.d. samples of \( X \) in which 0, 1, and 2 occur 30, 50, and 20 times, respectively.

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
