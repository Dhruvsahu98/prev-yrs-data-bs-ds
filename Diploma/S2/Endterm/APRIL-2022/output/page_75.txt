Question Label : Multiple Choice Question

Consider two samples, one from 
Normal(\(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2\)) and another from 
Normal(\(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2\)), where \(\sigma_1, \sigma_2\) are 
known. Suppose we want to test 
whether the means of the two 
distributions are equal. What 
test statistic and test can be 
applied for this situation? Let 
\(\bar{X}\) and \(\bar{Y}\) be the sample means. 
Let \( S^2_X \) and \( S^2_Y \) be the sample 
variances.

Options :

Test Statistic: \( T = \bar{X} - \bar{Y} \),
Hypothesis test: Z-test.

A. ✅

Test Statistic: \( T = \bar{X} - \bar{Y} \),
Hypothesis test: t-test.

B. ❌
