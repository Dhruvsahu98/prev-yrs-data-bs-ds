Choose the correct options from the following:

Options :

A. ❌ Consider two matrices \( A \) and \( B \). If both the matrix multiplications \( AB \) and \( BA \) are well-defined then \( A \) and \( B \) are square matrices.

B. ✔ Consider two matrices \( A \) and \( B \) of order \( n \). If \( A \) is not invertible, then \( AB \) is not invertible.

C. ❌ Consider two matrices \( A \) and \( B \) of order \( n \). If \( AB = B \), then \( B = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix of order \( n \).

D. ✔ There exists a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A \neq I \) such that \( A^3 = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix of order \( 2 \times 2 \).
