Suppose \( T : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3 \) is a linear transformation defined by
\[ T(x, y, z) = (x + y + z, x + 2y, y + z). \]

Let \( A \) denote the matrix representation of \( T \) with respect to the ordered bases
\[ \beta = \{(1, 1, 0), (2, 3, 4), (1, -1, 1)\} \] 
for the domain and 
\[ \gamma = \{(0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 0)\} \] 
for the codomain. Then the sum of the elements in the first row of \( A \) is
