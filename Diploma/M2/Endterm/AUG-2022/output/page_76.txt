Let \( W \) be a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) (with inner product as the dot product) such that
\[ W = \{ (x, y, z) \mid \text{det}(A) = 0 \}. \]
If \( \beta \) is an orthonormal basis of \( W \), then find the cardinality of the set \( \beta \).

Let \( T : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R} \) be a linear transformation such that \( T(x, y, z) = \text{det}(A) \). Let \( B \) be the matrix representation of \( T \) with respect to some ordered bases for the domain and the codomain. Let \( m \times n \) be the order of the matrix \( B \) and \( r \) be the nullity of \( B \). Then find the value of \( m + n + r \).
