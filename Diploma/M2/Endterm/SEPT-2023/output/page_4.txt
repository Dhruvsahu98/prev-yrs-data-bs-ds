Which of the following statement(s) is/are true for an $n \times n$ matrix $A$?

Options :

1. Let $\det(A) \neq 0$. Then determinant of $A$ is unaltered by swapping any two rows of $A$.

2. Determinant of $A$ is unaltered when a multiple of a row is added to another row.

3. For any real number $t$, $\det(tA) = t^{n} \det(A)$

4. If $D = P^{-1}AP$, then $D = A$.

Which of the following statement(s) is/are true for a system of linear equations $Ax=b$?

Options :

1. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are solutions of the system, then for any $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$, $\alpha x_1 + \beta x_2$ is also a solution if and only if $b=0$.

2. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are solutions of the linear equation, then $\alpha x_1 + \beta x_2$ is also a solution for any $b$ in the column space of $A$.

3. The system $Ax=0$ has a unique solution when the number of equations is less than the number of variables.

4. If the system $Ax=0$ has a unique solution, then the columns of $A$ are linearly independent.
