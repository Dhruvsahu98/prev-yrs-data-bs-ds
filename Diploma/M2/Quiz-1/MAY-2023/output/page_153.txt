Shivani, Sruthi and Smriti enjoyed shopping on a Sunday. Shivani bought 2 shirts, a T-shirt and 2 pants, whereas Sruthi bought a T-shirt and a pant and Smriti bought 2 shirts and a pant. They paid Rs. 600, Rs. 400 and Rs. 300 respectively. Suppose $x_1$ is the price of a shirt, $x_2$ is the price of a T-shirt and $x_3$ is the price of a pant. Then the above information forms a system of linear equations. If $Ax = b$ is the matrix representation of the above system, where $x = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix}$ is the vector that represents the price of a shirt, T-shirt and pant respectively, answer the given subquestions.
