6406531148901. ❌ If $A^n = 0$ for some $2 \times 2$ matrix $A$ and some non-zero natural number $n$, then $A$ must be $0$ (zero matrix of order $2$).

6406531148902. ✅ If a homogeneous system of linear equations $Ax = 0$ has a non-zero solution, then it must have infinite number of solutions.

6406531148903. ❌ If $A^3 = I$ for some $n \times n$ matrix $A$, then it is not necessary that $A^2$ is an invertible matrix.
