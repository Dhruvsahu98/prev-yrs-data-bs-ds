Which of the following subsets are not a vector subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with respect to usual addition and scalar multiplication ? 
1) $W = \{(x, y, z) | x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}, \text{ and } x^2 = z^2\}$
2) $W = \{(x, y, z) | x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}, \text{ and } x = z\}$
3) $W = \{(x, y, z) | x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}, \text{ and } x = y + z\}$
4) $W = \{(x, y, z) | x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}, \text{ and } (x + 1) + (y - 1) + z = 0\}$
Enter the serial number of the subset which is not a vector subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with respect to usual addition and scalar multiplication. (If the subset corresponding to serial number 2 is not a subspace, then enter 2 as your answer.)
