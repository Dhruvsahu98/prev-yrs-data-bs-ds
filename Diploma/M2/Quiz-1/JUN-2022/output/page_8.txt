Consider the vector space $\mathbb{R}^3$ with respect to usual addition and scalar multiplication,
i.e.,
Addition: $(x_1, y_1, z_1) + (x_2, y_2, z_2) = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2, z_1 + z_2)$;
$(x_1, y_1, z_1), (x_2, y_2, z_2) \in V$
Scalar multiplication: $c(x, y, z) = (cx, cy, cz); (x, y, z) \in V, c \in \mathbb{R}$
Suppose $W_1$ and $W_2$ are two vector subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^3$ (with respect to usual addition and scalar multiplication) defined as follows:
and 
$W_1 = \{(x, y, 0) | x, y \in \mathbb{R}\}$
$W_2 = \{(0, y, 0) | y \in \mathbb{R}\}$
with usual addition and scalar multiplication,
Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
