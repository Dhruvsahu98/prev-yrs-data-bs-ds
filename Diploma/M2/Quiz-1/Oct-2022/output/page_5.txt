Consider the following two statements:

P: $V = \mathbb{R}^2$, with the operations:

Addition:
$$(x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (x_1x_2, y_1y_2);$$

and

Scalar multiplication:
$$c(x, y) = (cx, cy); (x, y) \in V, c \in \mathbb{R}$$

is a vector space.

Q: Let $V$ be a vector space. If $u, v, w \in V$ are such that $au + bv + cw = 0$ for some scalars $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $ac \neq 0$, then $span\{u, v\} = span\{v, w\}$.

Consider the following statements:

* Statement 1: P is true, but Q is false.
* Statement 2: Q is true, but P is false.
* Statement 3: Both P and Q are true.
* Statement 4: Both P and Q are false.

Which one of the above statements is correct? (e.g. if Statement 1 is correct, then enter 1 as your answer).
