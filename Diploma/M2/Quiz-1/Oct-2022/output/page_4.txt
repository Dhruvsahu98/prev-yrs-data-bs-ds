If addition and scalar multiplication on $V = \mathbb{R}^2$ is defined as follows:

Addition: $(x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (0, 0)$;
Scalar multiplication: $c(x, y) = (0, 0)$; $(x, y) \in V, c \in \mathbb{R}$

Consider the following statements.

1. There exists an element 0 (called the zero vector of $V$) in $V$ such that $0 + v = v$, $\forall v \in V$.
2. For each vector of $v \in V$ and for each pair $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, $(a + b)v = av + bv$.
3. For each vector of $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and for each pair $v_1, v_2 \in V$, $a(v_1 + v_2) = av_1 + av_2$.
4. For each vector of $v \in V$ and for each pair $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, $(ab)v = a(bv)$.

Which of the above statements is not true with respect to the addition and scalar multiplication on $V = \mathbb{R}^2$ defined above? (Enter the serial number of the statement which is not true. If statement 2 is incorrect, then enter 2 as your answer.)
