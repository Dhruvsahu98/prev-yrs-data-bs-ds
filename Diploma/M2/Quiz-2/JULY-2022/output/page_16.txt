Let $\beta = \{v_1, v_2\}$ be the orthonormal basis of the row space obtained by using the Gram-Schmidt process (with respect to usual inner product) applied on the ordered basis of the row space given by the first row and the second row of the matrix A. If 
 $$v_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{195}}(b, c, d)$$
What is the value of $c$?
