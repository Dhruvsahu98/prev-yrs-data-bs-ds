Anamika, Subhasis and Shreya pool together $x$, $y$, and $z$ amounts of money (in thousands) respectively, every month. The sum is distributed across three accounts $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$ as $x+y+z$, $z-2y$ and $2y-z$ respectively. This can be thought of as a linear transformation

$T: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$

defined by 

$T(x,y,z) = (x+y+z, z-2y, 2y-z)$.

Note: A negative amount of money signifies the amount withdrawn from the accounts. Answer the subsequent questions using the information given above.
