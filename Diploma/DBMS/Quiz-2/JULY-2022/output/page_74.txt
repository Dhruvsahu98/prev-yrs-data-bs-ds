Which of the following statement(s) is/are true?
Options :
6406531166806.  ✅ Given a graph where all edges have positive weights, the shortest path produced by Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithm may be different, but the path weight would be the same.
6406531166807.  ❌ Given a graph where weights of all edges are unique, there is always a unique shortest path from a source to destination in such a graph.
6406531166808.  ✅ Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall's algorithm can calculate the shortest path correctly if the graph has negative edge weights but does not have negative weight cycles.
6406531166809.  ❌ The time complexity of Floyd-Warshall is O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
