Consider the following function that takes a list L of distinct integers and an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ len(L)) as input.

```python
#lower and upper argument represent lower index and upper index of L respectively
def mystery(L, lower, upper, k):
  if (k > 0 and k <= upper - lower + 1):
    pos = partition(L, lower, upper)
    if (pos - lower == k - 1):
      return L[pos]
    if (pos - lower > k - 1):
      return mystery(L, lower, pos - 1, k)
    else:
      return mystery(L, pos + 1, upper, k - pos + lower - 1)
```

In line 3, `partition` function treats the first element of L as a pivot and rearranges the list so that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are in the left part of the list, and all elements greater than the pivot are in the right part. In addition, it moves the pivot so that the pivot is the last element of the left part. The function returns the index of pivot in the list L.

Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.
