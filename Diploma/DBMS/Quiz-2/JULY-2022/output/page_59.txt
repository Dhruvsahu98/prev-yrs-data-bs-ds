```python
F = {
    fid -> fname, address, experience, designation,
    designation -> salary,
    experience -> designation
}
```

What is the highest normal form of the above relational schema **Faculty**?

Consider the relation **CAR**(LicenseNo, EngineSerialNo, Model, Year) and the following functional dependencies set

```python
F = {
    LicenseNo, EngineSerialNo -> Model,
    EngineSerialNo -> Year
    Model, Year -> EngineSerialNo
}
```
