Consider a relation **hotel\_information(c\_name, c\_id, mobile, room\_type, room\_no)** with the following functional dependencies:

$F = \{c\_id \rightarrow (c\_name, mobile),$
 $(c\_name, mobile) \rightarrow room\_no,$
 $room\_no \rightarrow room\_type\}$

**Options :**

A.  $\checkmark$ The above relation can be decomposed into smaller relations, each of which is in BCNF, such that the decomposition is dependency preserving.
B.  $\times$ The above relation can be decomposed into smaller relations, each of which is in BCNF, such that the decomposition is not dependency preserving.
C.  $\times$ The above relation can be decomposed into smaller relations, each of which is in 3NF, such that the decomposition is not dependency preserving.
D.  $\checkmark$ The above relation can be decomposed into smaller relations, each of which is in 3NF, such that the decomposition is dependency preserving.
