In the relational schema given below, the domains of all its attributes are atomic only.

R(employee\_num, employee\_name, department\_num, department\_name)

Suppose R satisfies the following functional dependencies:

```python
{employee_num -> employee_name,
 department_num -> department_name,
 employee_num -> department_name}
```

If R is decomposed into:

R1(employee\_num, employee\_name) and
R2(department\_num, department\_name),

then, which among the following statement(s) is/are correct?

Options :

6406531485433. ✅ R1 and R2 are in BCNF, but decomposition is not a dependency preserving one.

6406531485434. ✅ R1 and R2 are in BCNF, but decomposition is a lossy.

6406531485435. ❌ R1 and R2 are in BCNF, but decomposition is a lossless decomposition as well as dependency preserving.

6406531485436. ❌ R1 and R2 are not in BCNF, and decomposition is neither a lossless nor dependency preserving.
