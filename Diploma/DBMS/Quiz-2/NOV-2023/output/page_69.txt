Consider the relational schemas shown below.

```python
movie(m_id, title, year, p_id)
producer(p_id, name, contact)
```

Assume that both the relations consists of large number of tuples. Let the following queries be executed on the two relations.

1. `SELECT p.name, m.title FROM producer AS p NATURAL JOIN movie AS m WHERE m.year > '2002-12-31'`
2. `SELECT title, year FROM movie WHERE m_id = 'M025'`
3. `SELECT p.name, m.title FROM producer AS p, movie AS m WHERE m.p_id = p.p_id AND p.name = 'Yash'`

Identify which of the statement(s) is/are true?
