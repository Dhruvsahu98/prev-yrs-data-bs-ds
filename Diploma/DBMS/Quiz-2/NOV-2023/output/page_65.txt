Consider the relation R(A, B, C, D, E, G) with the following sets of functional dependencies
$F = \{AB \rightarrow C, AC \rightarrow B, AD \rightarrow E, B \rightarrow D, BC \rightarrow A, E \rightarrow G\}$

Let the R is decomposed in two ways:
D1 = R1(AB), R2(BC), R3(AD), R4(EG)
D2 = R1(ABC), R2(ACDE), R3(ADG)
