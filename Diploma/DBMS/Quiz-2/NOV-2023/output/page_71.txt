Consider the relational schema **car**(carEngineNo, model, fuelType, company, headQuarters, aadhaar, customer, state, mobile, purchaseDate) with the following set of functional dependencies (assume that all the attributes have atomic values).

$F = \{$
carEngineNo $\rightarrow$ (model, fuelType, company),
(carEngineNo, aadhaar) $\rightarrow$ purchaseDate,
company $\rightarrow$ headQuarters,
aadhaar $\rightarrow$ (customer, state),
customer $\rightarrow$ mobile,
mobile $\rightarrow$ aadhaar
$\}$

Check if the relational schema car is in BCNF or not. If car is not in BCNF, decompose into minimum X number of smaller relations, so that all the smaller relations are in BCNF as well as dependency preserving. The value of X is __________.
