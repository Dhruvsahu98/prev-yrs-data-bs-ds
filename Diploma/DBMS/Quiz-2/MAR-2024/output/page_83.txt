|---|---|---|
| 21f11 | Ram | CS |
| 21f12 | Rakesh | ME |
| 21f13 | Pranav | EE |
| 21f14 | Rajib | CS |
| 21f15 | Vikash | BT |

Table 2: **student**

| course\_id | title | dept\_name |
|---|---|---|
| C001 | DBMS | CS |
| C002 | CAD | ME |
| C003 | Digital | EE |
| C004 | PDSA | CS |

Table 3: **course**

Based on the given student and course table, what will be the output of the Python code given below?

```python
import psycopg2
def connectDb(dbname, username, pwd, address, portnum):
    try:
        connection = psycopg2.connect(database = dbname,
                                        user = username,
                                        password = pwd,
                                        host = address,
                                        port = portnum)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        query = ", 'SELECT ID FROM student, course EXCEPT ALL SELECT ID FROM student EXCEPT ALL SELECT ID FROM student', "
        cursor.execute(query)
        result = cursor.fetchall()
        count=0
        for row in result:
            count=count+1
        print(count)
        cursor.close()
    except (Exception, psycopg2.DatabaseError) as error:
        print(error)
    finally:
        connection.close()
connectDb("university", "postgres", "root", "127.0.0.1", "5432")
```
