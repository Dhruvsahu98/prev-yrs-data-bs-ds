In the relational schema given below, all attributes take atomic values only.
$R(employee\_num, employee\_name, department\_num, department\_name)$

Suppose $R$ satisfies the following functional dependencies:

$employee\_num \rightarrow employee\_name$

$department\_num \rightarrow department\_name$

If $R$ is decomposed into:
$R1(employee\_num, employee\_name)$ and
$R2(department\_num, department\_name)$,
then the decomposition is:

**Options :**

**A.** $\times$ a lossless decomposition as well as a dependency preserving one

**B.** $\checkmark$ not a lossless decomposition but dependency preserving

**C.** $\times$ a lossless decomposition but not dependency preserving

**D.** $\times$ neither a lossless decomposition nor dependency preserving
