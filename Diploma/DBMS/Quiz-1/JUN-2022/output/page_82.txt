Which of the following statement describes the correct relation between the given entity sets?

Note:
* Employee and Student are disjoint specializations of Member.
* Instructor and Project\_lead are overlapping specializations of Employee.
* Foundation\_level and Diploma\_level are disjoint specializations of Student.

Options:
6406531149141. ✅ Each member can be either an employee or a student or just a member of the degree project. However, a member cannot be an employee and a student at the same time.
6406531149142. ❌ Each employee can be an instructor or a project lead. However, an employee cannot be an instructor and a project lead at the same time.
6406531149143. ❌ Each student can be either a foundation\_level student or a diploma\_level student or both at the same time.
6406531149144. ✅ Each employee can be an instructor or a project lead or both at the same time.
