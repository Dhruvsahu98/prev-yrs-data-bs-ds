| BrandID | integer |
| BrandName | string |
| Add field |  |

| Designations |  |
|---|---|
| DesgID | integer |
| Salary | integer |

What will be the result of the following query?

```python
SELECT DriverName FROM Drivers D NATURAL JOIN Designations T WHERE T.Salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM Designations T, Brands B, Drivers D WHERE T.DesgID = D.DesgID AND B.BrandID = D.BrandID AND B.BrandName = 'Mercedes') INTERSECT SELECT DriverName FROM Drivers D NATURAL JOIN Designations T WHERE T.Salary < ALL (SELECT salary FROM Designations T, Brands B, Drivers D WHERE T.DesgID = D.DesgID AND B.BrandID = D.BrandID AND B.BrandName = 'Ferrari') 
```
