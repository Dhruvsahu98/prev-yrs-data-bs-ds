Consider the following case study:

An IIITM Online Degree Project needs a database to store information about instructors (identified by ins\_id, name and phone as attributes), courses (identified by cid, cname and credits as attributes), and health information (identified by health\_id and checkup\_date as attributes). The instructor can work in various courses and courses can have more than one instructor; each course is managed by an instructor and an instructor can manage more than one courses. A health information must be identified uniquely by health\_id when the instructor is known. We are not interested in information about a health record once the instructor leaves the organization.
