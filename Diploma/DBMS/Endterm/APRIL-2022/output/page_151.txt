A telecom company has $2^{16}$ customer records in a table **T** in their database. These records are sorted in ascending order of the attribute *customer\_id*, which is also the primary key of **T**. The data file is stored in a disk with a block size of 512 bytes. Assume that, in each block, the records are unspanned and are of fixed-length. Each record is of size 32 bytes, the size of the primary key field is 10 bytes and the size of the block pointer is 6 bytes.
