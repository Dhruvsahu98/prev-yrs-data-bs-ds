We have a dataset which has only numerical features. We are implementing the following model on this dataset. (Note: X and y are feature matrix and label vector respectively.)

```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import CategoricalNB
model = CategoricalNB()
model.fit(X,y)
```

We find that the performance of the model is unsatisfactory. Which of the following models may be useful to use instead of CategoricalNB?

Options :

A. NumericalNB

B. MultinomialNB

C. BernoulliNB

D. GaussianNB
