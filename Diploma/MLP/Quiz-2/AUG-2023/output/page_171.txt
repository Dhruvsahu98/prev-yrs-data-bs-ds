label \( y_i \). If \( X_i \) is a support vector what will be the output of this formula :

\[
y_i * (X_i^T W + W_0)
\]

\( W_0 \) and \( W \) are the estimated parameters from the model

Consider below code which of the following option is true for that

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
neigh = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=4)
neigh.fit(X_train)
print(neigh.kneighbors(X_test[0:1]))
```

Assume \( X_{train} \) and \( X_{test} \) are of type numpy.ndarray.

Options:

6406531963579. ❌ It will print nearest neighbours from the test point.

6406531963580. ❌ It will print the distance of test point from all the training points.
