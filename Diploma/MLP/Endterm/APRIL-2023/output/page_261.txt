In which of the following scenarios, the split will NOT be done at node N?

**Options**:

1. **6406531892518.** ❌ Number of samples at node N = 15. If it is split, it will result in 9 nodes in the left child and 6 nodes in the right child.

2. **6406531892519.** ✔ Number of samples at node N = 5. If it is split, it will result in 4 nodes in the left child and 2 nodes in the right child.

3. **6406531892520.** ✔ Number of samples at node N = 7. If it is split, it will result in 4 nodes in the left child and 3 nodes in the right child.

4. **6406531892521.** ✔ Number of samples at node N = 12. If it is split, it will result in 3 nodes in the left child and 9 nodes in the right child.
