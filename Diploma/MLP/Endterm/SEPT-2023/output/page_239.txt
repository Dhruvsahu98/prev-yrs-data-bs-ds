Bag_clf will throw an error as it only accepts decision tree classifiers as base classifiers.

6406532034031. 
Each base KNN classifier will be trained on the entire dataset.

6406532034032. 
The max_samples=0.5 parameter means each base estimator in the ensemble is trained on 50% of the training samples.

6406532034033. 
The ensemble will use sequential computation due to n_jobs=-1.

You're using a RandomForestClassifier from sklearn for a multi-class classification problem. You want to ensure diversity among the trees to avoid overfitting and increase robustness. Which combination of parameter settings would contribute MOST to achieving this objective?

Options :

Setting n_estimators to 10, max_depth to 3, and using criterion='entropy'.

6406532034035. 
Increasing the value of n_estimators, setting max_features to a value less than the total number of features, and setting bootstrap to False.

6406532034036. 
Setting n_estimators to a high value, using criterion='gini', and setting max_samples to a value less than the total number of samples.
