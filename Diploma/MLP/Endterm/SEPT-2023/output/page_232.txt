You’re working on a binary classification task using the ‘MLPClassifier’ to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on their browsing behavior. You’re concerned about overfitting due to the complexity of the model. You decide to increase the ‘alpha’ parameter to control overfitting. The following code snippet shows the application of ‘MLPClassifier’:

from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
import numpy as np

data = np.array([[10, 3], [20, 5], [5, 1], [15, 4], [8, 2]])

# Corresponding target labels (0: No Purchase, 1: Purchase)
target = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0])

# Initialize MLPClassifier with alpha parameter
clf = MLPClassifier(alpha=0.01, random_state=42)
clf.fit(data, target)

# Predict class labels
predicted_labels = clf.predict(data)

By setting the ‘alpha’ parameter to 0.01, how are you affecting the neural network model’s behavior?

Options :

6406532034068. ❋ Increasing the model’s complexity to fit the training data more closely.
6406532034069. ✔ Adding a stronger regularization term to the loss function, discouraging complex models.
6406532034070. ❋ Making the model more sensitive to outliers and noise in the data.
