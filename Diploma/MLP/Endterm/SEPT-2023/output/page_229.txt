```python
Consider the following code snippet that employs LogisticRegression from 
sklearn on a feature matrix X and corresponding label vector y:

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced', C=0.5)
model.fit(X, y)

Given the code above, which of the following statements is true?

Options :

6406532033990. The logistic regression model will give equal importance to both classes in an imbalanced dataset.

6406532033991. The model does not use any regularization because the parameter C is set.

6406532033992. The model will perform equally well on both imbalanced and balanced datasets due to the class_weight parameter.

6406532033993. The value of C indicates that the model will apply a regularization.
