You're using a DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree to build a classification model. Which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding the parameters and attributes of this classifier?

Options:

6406532034038. 
\[
\text{The max_depth parameter ensures that the tree is pruned to have a maximum depth, while the tree..max_depth attribute retrieves the depth of the actual tree that was built.}
\]

6406532034039. 
\[
\text{Setting min_samples_split to a value greater than 2 can prevent the tree from splitting on features that have very minimal influence, but this guarantees that all leaf nodes will contain fewer samples than this value.}
\]

6406532034040.
\[
\text{The criterion='entropy' parameter means that the decision tree will split nodes to maximize information gain, while the tree..impurity attribute retrieves the impurity of the root node.}
\]

6406532034041. 
\[
\text{If the class_weight parameter is set to 'balanced', the decision tree will always have balanced classes in its leaf nodes.}
\]
