```python
You're working with a dataset of customer purchase behavior, including attributes "Total Amount Spent" and "Number of Items Purchased." You decide to use K-means clustering to segment customers into groups based on these features. The following code snippet demonstrates the K-means clustering process:

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

data = np.array([[150, 6], [300, 12], [50, 2], [250, 8], [80, 3]])

# Initialize KMeans with 3 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(data)

# Predict cluster labels
labels = kmeans.labels_

# Centroid coordinates of clusters
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_

Based on the given code and the nature of the dataset, what does the variable 'labels' represent?

Options:

6406532034064. * The total amount spent by each customer.

6406532034065. âœ” The cluster assignments indicating which group each customer belongs to.

6406532034066. * The number of items purchased by each customer.

6406532034067. * The centroid coordinates of the clusters formed.
```
