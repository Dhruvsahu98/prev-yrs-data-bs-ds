```python
Consider the following code snippet where two decision trees are trained on the same dataset:

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target

tree_1 = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=None, min_samples_split=2,
                                min_samples_leaf=1)
tree_1.fit(X, y)

tree_2 = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, min_samples_split=20,
                                min_samples_leaf=10)
tree_2.fit(X, y)

Given the configurations of tree_1 and tree_2, which decision tree is more likely to overfit the training data?

Options :

6406532034028. tree_1

6406532034029. tree_2
```

Given the following code using BaggingClassifier with KNeighborsClassifier as the base estimator:

from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

base_knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

bag_clf = BaggingClassifier(base_knn, n_estimators=50, max_samples=0.5,
                            bootstrap=True, n_jobs=-1)

Which of the following statements is correct?
