```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np
X = np.array([[5, 4], [5, 6], [10, 8], [10, 12]])
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0).fit(X)
kmeans.labels_

Output: array([0, 0, 1, 1], dtype=int32)
```

Considering the above code, Which of the following do you think as correct output of
Print(kmeans.predict([[6, 5]]))

Options :

A. ✔ 0

B. ❋ 1

C. ❋ 5

Rahul is working on an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. He is not able to choose the optimum number of clusters(k) for his model (model is based on K-means algorithm). He tried to plot the elbow chart which is shown below. By looking at this chart, which option would you recommend Rahul as the most suitable value of number of clusters (k).
