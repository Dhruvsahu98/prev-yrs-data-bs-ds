Consider the following code and select the correct options. Assume that all the necessary libraries are imported.

from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
poly_transform = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2,
                                    interaction_only= True)
estimator = SGDRegressor(penalty='elasticnet',
                         l1_ratio=0.3)
poly_model = Pipeline([('polynomial_transform', poly_transform),
                       ('elasticnet', estimator)])

poly_model.fit(X, y)

Options :
A. ✔️ It will first transform the features into degree 2 such that power of 2 and higher of the same input feature are excluded.
B. ❌ It will first transform the features into degree 2 such that only power of 2 the same input feature are included.
C. ❌ It will not perform any regularization.
D. ✔️ It will apply both lasso and ridge penalties to the model.
