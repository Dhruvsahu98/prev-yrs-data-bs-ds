Consider a grid search for various learning rate values in SGDRegressor

from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
param_grid = [{'eta0':[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5]}]
gs = GridSearchCV(SGDRegressor(),param_grid,cv=5)
gs.fit(X,y)

Upon execution of GridSearchCV(), how many times the fit() method of the estimator 
would have been called internally?

Options :

A. ❉ 1

B. ✅ 25

C. ❉ 5

D. ❉ 125

Fill the name of the missing attribute in the following code:

from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 100, n_features=2, -----------=2)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], marker="o", c=y, s=25, edgecolor="k")

The output plot is shown in Figure 1:
