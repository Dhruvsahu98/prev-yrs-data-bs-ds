Define the **slope** of a node as the absolute difference in height between the left subtree and the right subtree of the node. Consider that the height of the empty tree is 0.

Consider the below AVL Tree.

\begin{tikzpicture}[
  level distance=1.5cm,
  level 1/.style={sibling distance=3cm},
  level 2/.style={sibling distance=1.5cm}
]
  \node {38}
    child {node {14}
      child {node {8}}
      child {node {23}
        child {node {18}}
      }
    }
    child {node {56}
      child {node {45}}
      child {node {82}
        child {node {70}}
      }
    };
\end{tikzpicture}
