Consider the following algorithm on a connected, weighted, and undirected graph with n vertices and m edges.
* Sort the edges as $[e_1, e_2, ..., e_m]$ in decreasing order of weight.
* Consider each edge $e_j$ in sorted order.
* If this edge $e_j$ is part of any cycle of the graph, then delete it. Otherwise, keep it in the resulting graph.

Which of the following statements is/are true?

Options :
6406531736742.  ✔️ Exactly $m-n+1$ edges will be deleted.
6406531736743.  ❌ At most, $n-1$ edges will be deleted.
6406531736744.  ✔️ After processing all m edges, the resulting graph is connected.
6406531736745.  ✔️ What remains at the end is a minimum cost spanning tree.
6406531736746.  ❌ After processing all m edges, the resulting graph has exactly n edges.
