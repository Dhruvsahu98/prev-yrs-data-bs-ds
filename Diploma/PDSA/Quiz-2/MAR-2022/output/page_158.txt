Consider the following function *mystery(arr, low, high)*, where *arr* is a list of strings and *low* and *high* are the first and last index of list *arr* respectively.

```python
def match(str1, str2):
    result = ''
    n1, n2 = len(str1), len(str2)
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < n1 and j < n2:
        if str1[i] != str2[j]:
            break
        result += str1[i]
        i, j = i + 1, j + 1
    return result

def mystery(arr, low, high):
    if low == high:
        return arr[low]
    if high > low:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        str1 = mystery(arr, low, mid)
        str2 = mystery(arr, mid + 1, high)
        return match(str1, str2)
```

Terminology:-

For example if string t = *abcdef*

- **Suffix** - A string *s* is a suffix of a string *t* if there exist a string *p* such that *t = ps*. (for example, *def*, *ef*)
- **Prefix** - A string *p* is a prefix of a string *t* if there exist a string *s* such that *t = ps*. (for example, *abc*, *ab*)
- **Subsequence** - A subsequence of a string is a sequence that can be derived from the given string by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. (for example, *acef*, *adf*)
- **Substring** - A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.(for example, *bcd*, *cdef*)
