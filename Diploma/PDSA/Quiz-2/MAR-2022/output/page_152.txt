In the given graph, if we try to find the shortest path from node 'a' to all other nodes using the Dijkstra's algorithm given below, in what order will the nodes be marked as True in the visited dictionary?

```python
def dijkstralist(WList,s):
    infinity = 1 + len(WList.keys())*max([d for u in WList.keys() for (v,d) in WList[u]])
    (visited,distance) = ({}, {})
    for v in WList.keys():
        (visited[v],distance[v]) = (False,infinity)
    distance[s] = 0
    for u in WList.keys():
        nextd = min([distance[v] for v in WList.keys() if not visited[v]])
        nextvlist = [v for v in WList.keys() if (not visited[v]) and distance[v] == nextd]
        if nextvlist == []:
            break
        nextv = min(nextvlist)
        visited[nextv] = True
        for (v,d) in WList[nextv]:
            if not visited[v]:
                distance[v] = min(distance[v],distance[nextv]+d)
    return(distance)
