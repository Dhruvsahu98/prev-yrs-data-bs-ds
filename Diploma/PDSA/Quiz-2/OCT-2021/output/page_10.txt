Consider the following algorithm on a connected weighted graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.
* Sort the edges as $[E1, E2, ..., Em]$ in decreasing order of weight.
* Consider each edge $Ej$ in sorted order.
* If this edge is part of a cycle, then delete it. Otherwise, keep it in the resulting graph.
