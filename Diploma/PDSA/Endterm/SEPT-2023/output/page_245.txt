Let `coins` be a list of $k$ coin denominations (positive integers) that are available in unlimited quantities. You want to pay a sum of Rupees $x$ using as few coins as possible from the coin denominations given in the list `coins`.

Consider the following greedy strategy:

Sort the coin denominations in descending order, and then repeatedly choose the largest coin denomination that is less than or equal to the remaining amount $x$. We subtract the chosen coin value from $x$ and continue this process until $x$ becomes zero.

Which of the following are counter-examples which prove that the given greedy strategy is not optimum.

**Options :**

6406532034123. ✖ `coins` = [6, 1, 5, 7] and $x$ = 15

6406532034124. ✖ `coins` = [10, 1, 2, 5] and $x$ = 25

6406532034125. ✔️ `coins` = [1, 2, 8, 9, 5, 10] and $x$ = 17
