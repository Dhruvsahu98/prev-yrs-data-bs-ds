Consider the following problem statement.

There are 45 saree printing machines in a printing press company. Each machine produces 150 sarees and consumes electricity worth Rs 8000 every month. A machine can be overloaded to print more sarees but it should not be loaded more than 20% of its usual production capacity. Demand of saree for the $i^{th}$ month is represented with variables $d_i$, $1 \leq i \leq 12$. In order to balance demand and production to optimise profit, the company can switch off a machine for a month, but during that month a maintenance charge of Rs 100 is required for that machine. Similarly in order to switch on a machine which was switched off previously a startup cost of Rs 30 is required for that machine. The press might produce surplus sarees, the cost to store these surplus sarees is Rs 10 per saree.

Assume we use the following notations for representing the variables required to model this into a LPP problem:

1. $m_i$: machines running in month $i$
2. $s_i$: sarees made in month $i$
3. $o_i$: sarees made in overloaded state in month $i$
4. $n_i$: machines started in the start of month $i$
5. $x_i$: machines switched off in the start of month $i$
6. $g_i$: number of surplus sarees at the end of month $i$
7. $d_i$: demand of saree for month $i$

Identify the correct constraints pertinent to the above problem exclusively from the below options.

Options :
6406531892640. ✅ $s_i = 150m_i + o_i$ 
6406531892641. ✖ $m_i = n_{i-1} - x_i$
