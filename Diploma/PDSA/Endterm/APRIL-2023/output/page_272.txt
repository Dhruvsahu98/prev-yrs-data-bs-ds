Linear probing is an open addressing scheme in computer programming for resolving hash collisions in hash tables. Linear probing operates by taking the original hash index and adding successive values linearly until a free slot is found.

A hash table contains 6 buckets indexed from 0 to 5 and uses linear probing to resolve collisions. The key values are integers and the hash function used is `key mod 6`. The values 47, 63, 38, 16 are inserted into the table.

What is the probability that the 0<sup>th</sup> index will be occupied by the next element to be inserted ?

Note: Assume that the numbers/keys are selected uniformly at random over the set of positive integers.

Options :
6406531892574.  * 0.5
6406531892575.  * 1
6406531892576.  ✔ 0.83
6406531892577.  * 0.33
6406531892578.  * Can't be decided because the probability depends upon the key's value
