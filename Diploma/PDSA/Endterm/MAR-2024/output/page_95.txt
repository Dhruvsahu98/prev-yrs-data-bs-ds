**Options :**

6406532577441. ✅ Symbols with higher probabilities are generally closer to the root of the tree

Define the **slope** of a node as the absolute difference in height between the left subtree and the right subtree of the node. Consider that the height of the empty tree is 0.

Consider the below AVL Tree.

\begin{tikzpicture}[level/.style={sibling distance=40mm/#1}]
\node [circle,draw] {38}
  child {node [circle,draw] {14}
    child {node [circle,draw] {8}}
    child {node [circle,draw] {23}
      child {node [circle,draw] {18}}}}
  child {node [circle,draw] {56}
    child {node [circle,draw] {45}}
    child {node [circle,draw] {82}
      child {node [circle,draw] {70}}}};
\end{tikzpicture}
