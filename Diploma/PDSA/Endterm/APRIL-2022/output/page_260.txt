Consider the following implementation for Stack.

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
    def Push(self,v):
        self.stack.append(v)
    def isempty(self):
        return self.stack == []
    def Pop(self):
        v = None
        if not self.isempty():
            v = self.stack.pop()
        return(v)
```

```python
def fun(S):
    if (not S.isempty()):
        i = S.Pop()
        fun(S)
        S.Push(i)
```

What operation is performed by the above function fun(S)? S is a stack created using the given class Stack.

**Options :**

A.  Leaves the stack S unchanged
B.  Reverses the order of elements in the stack S
C.  Swaps the elements of the top and bottom positions in stack S, keeping the other elements in between in the same order
D.  Empties the stack S
