Consider $n$ matrices $M_0, M_1, M_2 ... M_{n-1}$ which need to be multiplied. Let $C(i, j)$ be the cost required to multiply matrices $M_i$ to $M_j$ in the sequence. We compute $C(0, n-1)$ to get the overall cost.
Which of the following statement is true?
Options :
A. $\checkmark$ $C(i, j)$ depends on $C(i, k-1)$ and $C(k, j)$ for every $i < k \le j$
B. $\times$ $C(i, j)$ depends on $C(i, k-1)$ and $C(k, j)$ for every $i \le k \le j$
C. $\times$ $C(i, j)$ depends on $C(i, k)$ and $C(k, j)$ for every $i < k \le j$
D. $\times$ $C(i, j)$ depends on $C(i, k)$ and $C(k+1, j)$ for every $i < k \le j$

Consider the function `mystery()` that takes strings `x` and `y` as input. What will `mystery('ABRTCRT', 'ETAIBRC')` return? `LCS(x, y)` returns the length of the longest common subsequence of X and Y.
```python
def mystery(X, Y):
  m = len(X)
  n = len(Y)
  l = LCS(X, Y)
  return (m + n - l)
```
