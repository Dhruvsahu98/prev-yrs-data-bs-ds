Consider the following problem statement.
There are 15 saree printing machines in a printing press company. Each machine produces 500 sarees and consumes electricity worth Rs 15000 every month. A machine can be overloaded to print more sarees, but it should not be loaded more than 10% of its usual production capacity. Also, when the machine is overloaded, it consumes 20% more electricity. Demand of saree for the $i^{th}$ month is represented with variables $d_i | 1 <= i <= 12$. In order to balance demand and production to optimize profit, the company can switch off a machine for a month, but during that month a maintenance charge of Rs 60 is required for that machine. Similarly, in order to switch on a machine that was switched off previously, a startup cost of Rs 40 is required for that machine. The press might produce surplus sarees, the cost to store these surplus sarees is Rs 30 per saree. 
Assume we use the following notations for representing the variables required to model this into a LPP problem:
1. $m_i$: machines running in month $i$
2. $s_i$: sarees made in month $i$
3. $o_i$: sarees made in overloaded state in month $i$
4. $n_i$: machines started in the start of month $i$
5. $x_i$: machines switched off in the start of month $i$
6. $g_i$: number of surplus sarees at the end of month $i$
7. $d_i$: demand of saree for month $i$ 
Identify the correct constraints pertinent to the above problem exclusively from the below options.

**Options:**

6406531184513. $\times$ $s_i = 500m_i + g_i$

6406531184514. $\checkmark$ $m_i = m_{i-1} + n_i - x_i$

6406531184515. $\times$ $g_i = s_i - d_i$

6406531184516. $\checkmark$ $m_i <= 15$

6406531184517. $\checkmark$ $o_i <= 50m_i$
