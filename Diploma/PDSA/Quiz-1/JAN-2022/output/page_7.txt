Linear probing is an open addressing scheme in computer programming for resolving hash collisions in hash tables. Linear probing takes the original hash index and increments the value by 1 until a free slot is found. 

A hash table contains 10 buckets and uses linear probing to resolve collisions. The key values are integers and the hash function used is key mod 11. If key values 56, 166, 80, 16, 145 are inserted in to the table, in what location would the key value 145 be inserted?

NOTE: Enter your answer to the nearest integer.
