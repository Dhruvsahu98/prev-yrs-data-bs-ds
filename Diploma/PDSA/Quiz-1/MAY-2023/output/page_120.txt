L is a non-empty list of distinct positive integers. That is:
- L has at least one element
- No two elements of L are the same

If the following snippet of code terminates without any error after a finite number of iterations of the while loop, what is the output produced by it?

Hint: L.remove(x) removes the leftmost occurrence of x in L.

```python
# L is a non-empty list of distinct positive integers
# L has already been defined
val = 0
for x in L:
    val += x
while L != []:
    for y in range(1, 11, 2):
        if y in L:
            L.remove(y)
        else:
            L.append(y)
print(val)
```
