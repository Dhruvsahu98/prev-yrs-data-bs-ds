Consider a connected, directed graph on which DFS is executed. Which of the following options are true regarding pre and post numbering used in the DFS algorithm on the graph?
Options :
6406531149203.  If $(u,v)$ is an edge of the graph such that $[pre(u),post(u)]$ contains $[pre(v),post(v)]$ then the graph is necessarily cyclic
6406531149204.  If $(u,v)$ is an edge of the graph such that $[pre(u),post(u)]$ contains $[pre(v),post(v)]$ then the graph is necessarily cyclic
6406531149205.  If $(u,v)$ is an edge of the graph such that $[pre(u),post(u)]$ and $[pre(v),post(v)]$ are disjoint intervals then the graph is necessarily cyclic
