Consider a linked list made up of nodes whose structure is defined by the following class
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```
Assume we have a class LinkedList in which `head` refers to the first node of the linked list. A method `fun(self, curr_node, prev_node)` is defined in the LinkedList class, as given below:
```python
def fun(self, curr_node, prev_node):
    if curr_node.next is None:
        self.head = curr_node
        curr_node.next = prev_node
        return
    temp = curr_node.next
    curr_node.next = prev_node
    self.fun(temp, curr_node)
```
The initial state of the linked list before calling `fun` was: 34, 12, 67, 9, 12, 4
What would be the state of the linked list after calling `fun(1.head, None)`, where `1` is the LinkedList object?
