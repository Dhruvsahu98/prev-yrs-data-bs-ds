Consider the following DAG

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
\tikzstyle{every node}=[draw,circle,fill=white,minimum size=10pt,inner sep=0pt]
\node (A) at (0,1) {A};
\node (B) at (0,0) {B};
\node (C) at (1,0.5) {C};
\node (D) at (1.5,1) {D};
\node (E) at (1.5,0) {E};
\node (F) at (2.5,0.5) {F};
\node (G) at (3.5,1) {G};
\node (H) at (3.5,0) {H};

\draw[->] (A) -- (C);
\draw[->] (B) -- (C);
\draw[->] (D) -- (F);
\draw[->] (E) -- (F);
\draw[->] (F) -- (G);
\draw[->] (F) -- (H);
\end{tikzpicture}

The number of different topological orderings of the vertices of the graph is \_\_.
