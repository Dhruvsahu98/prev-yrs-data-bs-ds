Consider a list L of n sorted numbers that are circularly shifted k positions to the right.
For example, [-1, 0, 3, 4, 9, 12] is a sorted list.
[9, 12, -1, 0, 3, 4] : circularly shifted 2 positions to the right.
[3, 4, 9, 12, -1, 0] : circularly shifted 4 positions to the right.
What will be the complexity of the **most efficient algorithm** to search for the smallest element in L for the two cases listed below?
I. Value of k is not known.
II. Value of k is known.
**Options :**
6406531286151.  I. $O(n)$, II. $O(1)$
