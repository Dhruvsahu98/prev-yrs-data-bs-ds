```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

Consider an implementation of a singly linked list, where each node is created using the given class `Node`. Suppose it has only a `head` pointer that points to the first node of the linked list.

Which of the following statement(s) is/are true? Assume we are using the most efficient algorithms.
