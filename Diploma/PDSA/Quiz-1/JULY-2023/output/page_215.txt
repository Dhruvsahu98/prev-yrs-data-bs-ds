Linear probing is an open addressing scheme in computer programming for resolving hash collisions in hash tables. Linear probing takes the original hash index and increments the value by 1 until a free slot is found.

Consider the given hash table with hash function h(key) = key mod 5 which uses linear probing for solving collisions.

| Index | Key |
|---|---|
| 0 | 45 |
| 1 | 51 |
| 2 | 60 |
| 3 | 18 |
| 4 | 34 |

Which among the following options corresponds to possible orders of insertion of values in the hash table?

Options :

6406531932685. ❌ 34, 45, 18, 60, 51

6406531932686. ❌ 18, 45, 34, 60, 51
