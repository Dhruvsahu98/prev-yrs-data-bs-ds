Assume $s$ is a stack and $q$ is a queue. Push and Pop operations are usual stack operations, enqueue and dequeue are usual queue operations, and isEmpty() is a method that returns true if either the stack or the queue is empty. Assume that stack $s$ and Queue $q$ are empty initially.

```python
for i in range(5):
    s.Push(i)
q.Enqueue(1)
while not q.isEmpty():
    s.Push(q.Dequeue())
while not s.isEmpty():
    q.Enqueue(s.Pop())
while not q.isEmpty():
    print(q.Dequeue(), end = " ")
```
