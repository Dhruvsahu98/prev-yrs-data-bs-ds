Which of the following statements is **not true** about Quicksort?

**Options :**

6406531932672.  ❌  For every fixed strategy to choose a pivot for Quicksort, we can construct a worst-case input that requires time $O(n^2)$.

6406531932673.  ❌  If we could find the median in time $O(n)$, Quicksort would have worst-case complexity $O(n log n)$.

6406531932674.  ✅  $O(n log n)$.

If we randomly choose a pivot element each time, Quicksort will always terminate in time
