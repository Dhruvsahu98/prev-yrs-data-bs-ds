Which of the following is/are possible degree sequence(s) of vertices of a connected undirected graph with six vertices?

Note: Degree sequence is a series of positive integer $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ where each $a_i$ is the degree of the $i^{th}$ vertex of the graph.

Which of the following statement(s) is/are **true** about Depth First Search (DFS) on an undirected and connected graph?

**Options :**

6406531562834. ✅ DFS can be used to detect cycles in the graph.

6406531562835. ✅ DFS can be used to identify connected components in an undirected graph.

6406531562836. ✅ Using an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix can improve the worst case complexity to $O(V + E)$, where V is number of vertices and E is number of edges.

6406531562837. ❌ In an unweighted graph, DFS can be used to identify the shortest path from a starting vertex $s$ to every other vertex in the graph

6406531562838. ✅ DFS always produces the same number of tree edges irrespective of the order in which the vertices are considered for DFS.
