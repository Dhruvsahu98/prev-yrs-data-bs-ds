**Linear probing** is an open addressing scheme in computer programming for resolving hash collisions in hash tables. Linear probing takes the original hash index and increments the value by 1 until a free slot is found. 

A hash table contains 8 buckets indexed from 0 to 7 and uses linear probing to resolve collisions. The key values are integers and the hash function used is `key mod 8`. If `key` values 25, 87, 48, 64, 11 are inserted in to the table in the given order, at what index would the key value 120 be inserted after them?
