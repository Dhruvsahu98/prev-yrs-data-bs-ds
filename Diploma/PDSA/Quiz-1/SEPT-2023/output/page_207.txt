Linear probing is an open addressing scheme in computer programming for resolving hash collisions in hash tables. Linear probing takes the original hash index and increments the value by 1 until a free slot is found.
A hash table contains 13 buckets(indexed from 0 to 12) and uses linear probing to resolve collisions. The key values are integers and the hash function used is `key mod 13`. If key values 14, 55, 1, 44, 83, 122, 131 are inserted into the table, in what index would the key value 131 be inserted?
